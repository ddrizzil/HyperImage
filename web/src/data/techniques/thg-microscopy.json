  "summary": "Third harmonic generation microscopy is a label-free nonlinear optical technique that generates contrast from optical interfaces and heterogeneities by converting three incident photons of frequency ω into a single photon at frequency 3ω. Unlike SHG which requires non-centrosymmetric structures, THG occurs at refractive index discontinuities and is sensitive to layer boundaries, lipid interfaces, and material inhomogeneities. In cultural heritage, THG reveals varnish-paint interfaces, layer structures in cross-sections, oil droplets in binding media, and interfaces between different pigment layers, all without staining or sample damage.",

    "principle": "THG is a third-order nonlinear optical process where three photons of the same frequency (ω) interact simultaneously with a material to generate a single photon at exactly three times the frequency (3ω, one-third the wavelength). Unlike SHG, THG does not require broken inversion symmetry - it occurs in all materials but is strongest at interfaces where the third-order susceptibility χ⁽³⁾ or refractive index changes abruptly. THG is a parametric process (no energy absorbed), coherent (phase-dependent), and provides intrinsic 3D sectioning. The signal is generated primarily at optical interfaces, making THG an excellent 'interface detector' complementary to SHG's 'structure detector' role.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "THG arises from the third-order nonlinear susceptibility χ⁽³⁾, which is non-zero in all materials (including centrosymmetric ones). In homogeneous media, forward and backward THG interfere destructively (Gouy phase shift), resulting in no net signal. However, at interfaces where χ⁽³⁾ or refractive index n changes, this destructive interference is broken, producing strong THG. Key sources: (1) Refractive index boundaries (varnish-air, varnish-paint, paint layers). (2) Lipid droplets (spherical interfaces, high χ⁽³⁾ contrast). (3) Organelles and membranes in biological materials. (4) Pigment particle boundaries. THG signal scales as (intensity)³, requiring even higher peak powers than SHG.",

    "interpretationGuidelines": "**THG signal location:** Bright lines/regions indicate refractive index discontinuities. In paint cross-sections: upper varnish-air interface, varnish-paint boundary, paint-ground boundary, and inter-layer boundaries all produce THG. **Signal intensity:** Brighter THG indicates larger Δn (refractive index step). Varnish-air (Δn ≈ 0.5) very bright; paint-paint layers (Δn ≈ 0.05-0.2) moderate. **Oil droplets:** Spherical lipid droplets produce strong THG due to curved interface geometry - appear as bright spots. **Homogeneous regions:** No THG in uniform materials (within paint layers, within varnish). **Interface quality:** Sharp THG line = well-defined interface; diffuse THG = gradual transition or rough interface.",
    "commonPitfalls": [
      "Confusing THG with three-photon excited fluorescence (3PEF): Both occur at similar wavelengths. 3PEF is broadband, isotropic, can photobleach. THG is narrowband (λ/3), coherent (directional), instantaneous. Use spectral detection to verify narrow emission at exactly λ/3. Check repeated scans show no photobleaching. Verify forward/backward emission ratio consistent with coherent process.",
      "Over-interpreting THG intensity as absolute refractive index: THG intensity depends on multiple factors: χ⁽³⁾, refractive index mismatch, interface thickness, laser focus position. Not straightforward to extract absolute Δn. Use THG for relative comparisons (interface A vs. B) or qualitative interface detection. Combine with ellipsometry for quantitative refractive index.",
      "Missing interfaces due to phase matching conditions: THG signal depends on Gouy phase. At certain depths, destructive interference can reduce signal even at real interfaces. Acquire Z-stacks and look for interface appearance/disappearance with depth. Use theoretical understanding of Gouy phase shift.",
      "Artifacts from coverslip and mounting defects: Coverslip surface, scratches, dust, and bubbles produce strong spurious THG signals that can mask real sample features. Use ultra-clean coverslips; image sample region away from known artifacts; compare with transmitted light image to identify bubbles/debris.",
      "Assuming all interfaces produce equal THG: THG strength depends on both Δn and χ⁽³⁾ discontinuity. Oil-water interfaces (similar n but different χ⁽³⁾) can produce strong THG. Consider both refractive index and nonlinear susceptibility changes. Use complementary techniques (refractive index measurement) to interpret THG.",
      "Insufficient laser power yielding noise-dominated images: THG ∝ I³, so even more power-dependent than SHG. Weak signals easily lost in noise. Optimize power (balance signal vs. damage); use longer averaging; verify pulse width is minimal (dispersion compensation)."

Combined SHG (collagen sizing) and THG (interfaces) in dual-channel acquisition. Z-stacks through 50 μm thickness. Compared with visible microscopy, UV fluorescence, and FTIR mapping on same cross-sections. THG revealed three distinct varnish layers: original 17th-century varnish (thin, 5-10 μm, irregular upper interface), 19th-century restoration varnish (20-30 μm, smooth interfaces), and modern conservation varnish (15 μm, very uniform). Each varnish-varnish interface appeared as bright THG line, allowing precise thickness measurements impossible with visible microscopy alone. Oil droplets in original paint layers produced localized THG spots (0.5-2 μm diameter), indicating lipid-rich binding medium. THG detected micro-cracks at paint-ground interface invisible to conventional methods. SHG showed collagen sizing only at canvas-ground interface; THG showed sizing penetration depth (~20 μm) as gradual interface intensity decrease. First comprehensive use of THG to distinguish multiple varnish campaigns in Old Master painting.",

THG imaging: 1200 nm excitation, 40×/1.3 NA oil objective, 60 mW average power. Compared forward-detected (F-THG) and backward-detected (B-THG) signals. Correlated with Raman microscopy (pigment ID) and FTIR (gum arabic confirmation). THG successfully visualized layer boundaries in watercolor despite high transparency (visible microscopy showed little contrast). Each pigment-gum layer interface produced moderate THG signal; paper-watercolor interface very bright. Oil droplets in gum arabic (from egg white sizing deterioration) appeared as intense THG spots, not visible in conventional microscopy. Layer thicknesses measured: 2-8 μm per application (consistent with Turner's technique). Forward THG signal stronger than backward, confirming thin-film geometry (<50 μm total). THG detected zinc white particles (transparent in visible light) via particle-binder interface contrast. Unexpected finding: thick varnish layer applied to some watercolors (historically debated) clearly revealed by strong THG at surface. Demonstrated THG's unique capability to image transparent layer structures where conventional microscopy fails.",
