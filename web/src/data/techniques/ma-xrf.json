  "summary": "MA-XRF is a non-destructive elemental imaging technique that scans an X-ray beam across artwork surfaces to create spatial distribution maps of elements like lead, mercury, iron, copper, and calcium. The technique reveals hidden compositions, artist alterations (pentimenti), and pigment layering by detecting characteristic X-ray fluorescence from elements in paint layers, allowing researchers to \"see\" beneath the surface without sampling. MA-XRF has become one of the most important tools in technical art history since the 2000s.",

    "principle": "When X-rays with sufficient energy strike atoms in a material, they can eject inner-shell electrons (typically K or L shell). This creates an unstable electronic configuration. An electron from a higher shell fills the vacancy, releasing energy as a characteristic X-ray photon with energy specific to the element and transition type. By detecting these fluorescent X-rays and mapping their intensity across a surface, MA-XRF creates elemental distribution images.\n\nThe technique is based on three fundamental processes:\n\n1. **Photoelectric absorption**: Incident X-rays eject inner-shell electrons\n\n2. **Atomic relaxation**: Outer-shell electrons fill vacancies\n\n3. **Fluorescent emission**: Characteristic X-rays are emitted\n\nThe depth of analysis depends on X-ray energy and material composition, typically sampling 10-200 μm in paint layers.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "X-ray fluorescence occurs when incident X-rays have sufficient energy to ionize inner-shell electrons (K or L shells). The resulting characteristic X-ray emission is element-specific, with energies ranging from ~1 keV (light elements) to ~100 keV (heavy elements).",

    "interpretationGuidelines": "**Pigment Identification Strategy:**\n1. Start with most abundant/obvious elements (Pb, Fe, Cu, Ca)\n2. Look for spatial correlation of elements indicating compounds (Example: Hg + S together → vermilion (HgS))\n3. Consider historical context (painting date, artist, region)\n4. Use complementary techniques to confirm: Raman (molecular/crystal structure), FTIR (organic binders), Microscopy (particle morphology)\n\n**Layering and Stratigraphy:**\n- Bright regions: high concentration or top layer\n- Diffuse signals: deeper layers or diluted pigments\n- Sharp boundaries: distinct paint application\n- Gradients: mixing, diffusion, or variable thickness\n\n**Pentimenti and Underpaintings:**\n- Look for elements not visible in surface layer\n- Pb distribution showing hidden compositions\n- Compare to visible and IR imaging\n\n**Degradation Phenomena:**\n- Lead soaps: Pb migration patterns (bright spots)\n- Pigment alteration: changes in oxidation state (requires XANES)\n- Metal corrosion: Cu, Fe degradation products\n\n**Quantitative vs. Qualitative:**\n- MA-XRF is primarily qualitative/semi-quantitative\n- Absolute concentrations difficult due to: Unknown matrix composition, Variable sample thickness, Self-absorption effects, Geometric factors\n- Relative comparisons within same painting are valid\n- Ratios (e.g., Pb/Ca) can be informative",
    "commonPitfalls": [
      "Confusing scatter peaks with element signals: Compton and Rayleigh scatter peaks from tube spectrum. Learn to recognize scatter peaks at tube characteristic energies; filter removes most low-energy scatter",
      "Peak overlap misidentification: Pb Lα (10.55 keV) vs. As Kα (10.54 keV); Pb Lβ (12.61 keV) vs. As Kβ (11.73 keV). Use spectral deconvolution; check for multiple peaks of same element; confirm with complementary techniques",
      "Interpreting intensity as absolute concentration: Brightness in elemental map ≠ absolute wt% due to matrix effects. Use relative comparisons; state \"high intensity\" rather than \"high concentration\"",
      "Missing light elements: Na, Mg, Al have low fluorescence yield and are heavily absorbed. Use vacuum chamber or He purge for light element detection; acknowledge detection limits in reports",
      "Depth ambiguity: Cannot distinguish if element is at surface or deeper layer. Combine with OCT, THz, or cross-section analysis; use confocal XRF if available",
      "Frame or mounting shadows: Reduced intensity at edges due to geometric obstruction. Remove frames when possible; scan overlap regions; correct for geometry",
      "Sum peaks and escape peaks: Sum peaks (double energy) and escape peaks (E - 1.74 keV for Si detector). Recognize systematic peak positions; use pileup correction; reduce count rate",
      "Substrate interference: Elements from canvas (Ca sizing), wood support, or previous restorations. Document sample construction; compare maps to identify substrate contributions",
      "Surface contamination: Dust, handling deposits, or environmental pollutants give spurious signals. Gentle surface cleaning before scan; look for localized anomalies",
      "Over-interpretation of weak signals: Noise or trace contaminants misidentified as significant pigments. Set threshold for detection limit (typically >3σ above background); verify with independent measurement"
