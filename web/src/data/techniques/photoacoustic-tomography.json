  "summary": "Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), also called optoacoustic tomography (OAT), is a hybrid imaging technique combining optical excitation with ultrasonic detection to generate 3D images of optical absorption contrast within turbid media. Pulsed laser light (ns-scale, typically NIR 700-1200 nm) illuminates the sample; absorbed photons generate localized transient heating (mK rise); thermoelastic expansion launches broadband ultrasonic waves (MHz frequencies) that propagate to the surface where an array of ultrasound transducers detects them. Time-of-flight of acoustic signals encodes depth; computational reconstruction algorithms (filtered back-projection, time-reversal, model-based) convert acoustic waveforms into 3D maps of optical absorption coefficient. PAT achieves optical contrast (molecular specificity: hemoglobin, melanin, lipids via spectral unmixing) with ultrasound resolution (100 μm - 1 mm) and penetration depth (mm to cm, exceeding pure optical imaging limited by scattering), and is emerging as a powerful tool for non-invasive subsurface imaging of cultural heritage objects.",

    "principle": "Photoacoustic tomography exploits the photoacoustic effect for volumetric imaging. A short laser pulse (typically 5–10 ns) is delivered to a turbid medium. Absorbed photons raise the local temperature by ΔT in the μK–mK range. Under stress confinement (pulse duration much shorter than the acoustic transit time across the absorber), this rapid heating causes thermoelastic expansion and launches a broadband ultrasonic pressure wave. The initial pressure rise p_0 is proportional to the product of the local absorption coefficient μ_a, the optical fluence Φ, and the Grüneisen parameter Γ (which encodes the medium’s thermoelastic properties). These waves propagate outward at the sound speed c_s with minimal scattering compared to photons. An array of ultrasound detectors records the time-resolved pressure p(r⃗_d, t) at many positions. Reconstruction algorithms (e.g. filtered back-projection, time-reversal, iterative model-based inversion) solve the inverse problem p(r⃗_d, t) → p_0(r⃗) → μ_a(r⃗), yielding a 3D map of optical absorption.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "Unlike purely optical imaging, where multiple scattering scrambles photon paths and limits depth resolution, PAT converts optical absorption into acoustic waves that travel ballistically through soft, weakly attenuating media. This gives optical contrast (sensitive to chromophore absorption spectra: pigments, inks, binders) while inheriting the centimeter-scale penetration and spatial resolution of ultrasound. In heritage contexts, PAT can reveal carbon-based underdrawings beneath highly scattering or absorbing paint layers (e.g., lead white impasto), map pigment distributions in three dimensions, and visualize hidden structural features in wood and other turbid substrates.",

Optical penetration determines how deeply sufficient fluence reaches to excite absorbers, while acoustic propagation and detection determine how far the generated waves can travel back to the detectors with acceptable SNR. In turbid heritage materials (paints, wood, textiles), NIR wavelengths (700–1000 nm) offer a compromise between absorption and scattering, giving optical penetration on the order of 1–10 mm. Ultrasound in soft, low-loss media can propagate over centimeters, so in most heritage cases the optical transport is the limiting factor. Practical PAT imaging of paintings and polychrome objects typically achieves 0.5–10 mm depth, with deeper imaging (up to ~20 mm) possible in relatively transparent media like some woods.",

Bright regions correspond to strong absorbers (e.g., carbon-based underdrawings, dark pigments, iron-gall inks), while dim regions correspond to weakly absorbing materials (e.g., lead white in NIR, many binders, voids). Because PAT is sensitivity-weighted by both μ_a and the local fluence Φ, absolute quantitative interpretation requires calibration or modeling of fluence; in many heritage applications, PAT is used qualitatively or semi-quantitatively to locate and compare features rather than to provide absolute concentrations. Depth coordinates must be interpreted with knowledge of the assumed sound speed and potential heterogeneities; cross-checking with phantoms, OCT, or physical section measurements improves confidence. Whenever possible, PAT findings should be corroborated with complementary techniques (IRR, X-radiography, MA-XRF, Raman, FTIR, PAS) to assign specific materials and to distinguish true subsurface structures from artifacts."

        "year": "2021",
        "objectType": "Oil on canvas portrait attributed to the Rembrandt workshop, with extensive lead white impasto obscuring potential underdrawing",
        "researchQuestion": "Can PAT reveal carbon-based underdrawing lying hundreds of micrometers beneath dense lead white paint layers that are opaque to conventional infrared reflectography?",
        "methodology": "A custom PAT system using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with OPO tuned to 800 nm (10 ns pulses, ~15 mJ at the painting surface, 10 Hz) illuminated a 50×60 mm region of the face. A 5 MHz, 128-element linear ultrasound array in gel–membrane contact acquired RF data on a 0.5 mm raster grid, with 20 pulse averages per position. Data were reconstructed using k-Wave time-reversal with an assumed sound speed of 1800 m/s (optimized using calibration phantoms). The resulting 3D absorption volume (100×120×50 voxels, ~0.5×0.5×0.05 mm³) was compared with X-radiography, IR reflectography, and cross-section microscopy.",
        "keyFindings": "PAT revealed a network of high-absorption linear features at depths of 0.3–0.8 mm beneath the surface corresponding to a carbon-based underdrawing. These lines matched expected anatomical features (eyes, nose, mouth) and were invisible in both visible light and IR reflectography due to the opacity of the overlying lead white. Depth profiling showed the underdrawing located near the interface between the ground and the first paint layers, with depth estimates in good agreement (within ~0.1 mm) with micro-sampled cross-sections. X-radiography showed strong Pb signals in the overpaint but no direct evidence of carbon. The combined PAT–X-ray–IRR analysis clarified the painting’s stratigraphy and confirmed that the underdrawing belonged to the original composition rather than to later retouching.",
        "significance": "This study demonstrated, for the first time, that PAT can non-invasively image carbon-based underdrawings through millimeter-scale, highly scattering lead white paint where IR reflectography fails. It established PAT as a complementary modality to X-radiography and MA-XRF for investigating complex paint stratigraphies and informed decisions about cleaning and attribution in high-value old master paintings."

X-radiography excels at detecting dense materials, MA-XRF reveals elemental composition near the surface, and PAT adds volumetric absorption contrast for organics and inorganics.

      "Significant system complexity, requiring expertise in laser safety, acoustics, reconstruction algorithms, and heritage science",
      "Acquisition times can be long (tens of minutes to hours for high-resolution 3D volumes), limiting throughput for large collections",
      "Spatial resolution (∼100 μm–1 mm) is lower than that of OCT or microscopy and may not resolve extremely fine features",
      "Depth penetration is ultimately limited by optical attenuation; very dense or highly scattering surface layers may prevent access to deeper structures",
      "Acoustic coupling (water or gel) can be challenging for some objects, particularly large or highly sensitive paintings and textiles",

    "whenToUse": "Best employed when conventional methods (especially IR reflectography and X-radiography) provide incomplete information about subsurface absorbers, when depth-resolved knowledge of pigment or underdrawing distribution is crucial for interpretation or treatment planning, and when the institutional infrastructure can support advanced imaging campaigns. PAT is particularly promising for investigating underdrawings beneath opaque or complex paint stratigraphies, for mapping internal structures in wood panels, and for research projects that justify the investment in specialized equipment.",
    "whenNotToUse": "PAT is not the first-line tool when surface-sensitive methods (IRR, OCT, Raman, FTIR, MA-XRF) can already answer the research question, when only very fine surface detail (<10–20 μm) is required, when budget or infrastructure cannot support high-cost, high-complexity systems, or when the object cannot be safely coupled to a water/gel medium or transported to a suitable facility. In such cases, alternative non-contact or lower-cost imaging methods may be preferable."
