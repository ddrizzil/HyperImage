  "summary": "Digital X-ray radiography uses electronic detectors (flat-panel detectors or computed radiography plates) instead of photographic film to capture X-ray transmission images. The technique provides immediate image feedback, superior dynamic range, digital archiving, and advanced image processing capabilities while maintaining the fundamental physics of traditional radiography. DR has largely replaced film-based systems in modern conservation labs due to improved workflow efficiency and image quality.",

    "Digital image enhancement (contrast adjustment, edge detection, pseudo-color)",

    "principle": "Digital radiography operates on the same physical principles as film radiography - differential X-ray attenuation through materials of varying density and atomic composition. The key difference lies in detection: instead of photographic emulsion, digital detectors use either scintillator-photodiode arrays (direct digital radiography, DDR) or photostimulable phosphor plates (computed radiography, CR). X-ray photons are converted to visible light in a scintillator layer, then to electrical charge in a photodiode array or stored in phosphor crystals. The electronic signal is digitized to create a grayscale image where pixel values represent X-ray transmission intensity.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "Detection mechanisms: (1) Direct conversion - X-rays generate electron-hole pairs in semiconductor (amorphous selenium) converted directly to electrical signal. (2) Indirect conversion - X-rays excite scintillator (CsI, Gd₂O₂S) producing visible photons detected by photodiode array or CCD. (3) Photostimulable phosphor - X-rays create trapped electron states; laser scanning releases stored energy as light.",

    "commonPitfalls": [
      "Over-reliance on auto-processing: Vendor software may apply aggressive processing (edge enhancement, noise reduction) that obscures subtle features or creates false details. Always review raw unprocessed data; understand what processing has been applied; create multiple versions with different processing",
      "Ignoring exposure indicator: Digital's wide latitude tolerates over/under-exposure, but image quality suffers (excessive noise or saturation). Check exposure index; aim for middle of target range; don't assume 'visible = good'",
      "Lossy compression artifacts: JPEG compression introduces blocking artifacts that mimic or obscure real features. Always archive as lossless (16-bit TIFF, PNG, DICOM); use JPEG only for presentations; never compress raw data",
      "Monitor calibration neglect: Uncalibrated display misrepresents gray levels and contrast; different monitors show same image differently. Use calibrated medical-grade monitors; regular calibration checks; DICOM grayscale display function (GSDF) compliance",
      "Insufficient dynamic range utilization: Using only 8-bit display or export when 16-bit data available loses subtle contrast. Work in 16-bit throughout workflow; only convert to 8-bit for final presentation if necessary",
      "Discarding raw data: Saving only processed JPEG or lossy format prevents re-analysis with different parameters. Always archive original raw detector output; processed versions are derivative, not primary data"

        "description": "12 panels radiographed using Dürr NDT CR system with 35 × 43 cm phosphor plates. Multiple overlapping exposures per panel at 80 kV, 10 mAs. Images digitized at 50 μm resolution (16-bit). Stitched into seamless composites. Compared with historical film radiographs from 1950s-80s. Combined with MA-XRF and other imaging. DR revealed previously invisible pentimenti due to superior dynamic range and digital enhancement. Panel construction details (dowels, battens) more clearly visualized than in film. Lead white brushwork patterns sharply delineated. Instant feedback allowed optimization for each panel's unique density. Digital archiving and processing enabled new discoveries through re-analysis with different window/level settings. Virtual 'dismantling' of complex construction via digital layer separation. Established CR/DR as superior replacement for film in large-scale heritage imaging projects.",
