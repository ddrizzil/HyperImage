  "summary": "Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is a photothermal technique that detects absorbed light by measuring acoustic waves generated when modulated radiation heats a sample. Chopped or pulsed light (UV-Vis-NIR, 200-2500 nm typical) irradiates the sample; absorbed photons convert to heat via non-radiative relaxation; periodic heating causes thermal expansion generating pressure waves (ultrasound, 10 Hz - 10 MHz) detected by microphone or piezoelectric transducer. The photoacoustic signal amplitude versus wavelength yields an absorption spectrum revealing electronic and vibrational transitions. Unlike conventional transmission/reflectance spectroscopy, PAS directly measures absorption (not affected by scattering), penetrates opaque materials (depth-profiling via modulation frequency: 10 Hz → mm-scale, 10 kHz → μm-scale), and requires no sample preparation. Heritage applications include non-destructive pigment identification in paintings, subsurface layer detection through paint/varnish, photodegradation monitoring, and analysis of highly scattering materials (powders, textiles, paper) where conventional spectroscopy fails.",

    "principle": "Photoacoustic effect (Bell, 1880): modulated light absorbed by sample → periodic heating → thermal expansion/contraction → pressure waves (sound) in surrounding gas/coupling medium. Signal amplitude proportional to absorbed light intensity (not reflected/transmitted). Depth sensitivity controlled by thermal diffusion length μ_th = √(α/πf), where α = thermal diffusivity, f = modulation frequency. Low f (10-100 Hz) → large μ_th (mm-scale, bulk); high f (10-100 kHz) → small μ_th (μm-scale, surface-sensitive).",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "Light absorption → excited electronic/vibrational states → non-radiative relaxation (internal conversion, vibrational cascade) → heat deposited in sample → temperature oscillates at modulation frequency → thermal expansion generates pressure wave → acoustic wave propagates to detector (microphone in gas cell or piezo transducer on sample). Signal magnitude I_PA ∝ I₀ · β · μ_a, where I₀ = incident intensity, β = absorption coefficient, μ_a = thermal-to-acoustic conversion efficiency (depends on sample thermal properties, geometry). Unlike transmission (Beer's law, affected by scattering), PAS insensitive to scattering (scattered photons still eventually absorbed → heat → signal).",

Acquisition: 400-800 nm, 5 nm steps, 2 s integration per wavelength. Normalized to carbon black reference. Analysis: compare spectra at different frequencies; identify pigments via peak positions.",

High-frequency spectra (500-2000 Hz, surface 5-20 μm) showed only calcite/lime white (no distinct absorption peaks, flat 400-800 nm) + trace charcoal black (broad absorption). Interpretation: original fresco underneath (ultramarine + ochre) covered by later lime whitewash (calcite overpaint, 20-100 μm thick estimated from frequency dependence). Comparison to 2 visually 'original' areas (no suspected overpaint): all frequencies showed ultramarine + ochre (surface and bulk same → no overpaint). Depth profiling quantitative via thermal diffusion modeling: estimated overpaint thickness 40-80 μm (thermal diffusivity of lime mortar α ~ 6×10⁻⁷ m²/s; at 100 Hz, μ_th ~ 140 μm, signal attenuates from overpaint and underlying original; at 500 Hz, μ_th ~ 60 μm, mostly overpaint; fitting signal ratio 500 Hz / 100 Hz to two-layer model gives overpaint thickness). Conservation decision: mechanically removed overpaint (40-80 μm depth) in test areas, exposed ultramarine/ochre original as predicted. Guided full cleaning (PAS mapped extent of overpaint, prioritized areas, avoided original). Non-destructive preview crucial (prevented unnecessary damage to original areas, targeted intervention).",
        "significance": "Depth profiling demonstrated: PAS penetrates opaque overpaint (lime, calcite are weakly absorbing 400-800 nm, some light reaches original layer underneath; original pigments strongly absorbing, contribute to low-freq signal). Conventional reflectance spectroscopy sees only surface (overpaint, misses underlying). Raman struggles (lime fluorescence, pigment grains deep). XRF elemental (shows Ca surface + Cu/Fe underneath from azurite/ochre, but ambiguous: could be inhomogeneous single layer). PAS depth-resolved absorption = functional stratigraphy. Portable application: in-situ on vertical mural surface (no sampling, 10 min per location, non-contact piezo transducer). Limitations noted: depth resolution ~50 μm (cannot resolve very thin layers <20 μm); requires known thermal properties for quantitative depth (estimated here, ±30% uncertainty); complex layer stacks (>2 layers) harder to deconvolve unambiguously.",

UV-Vis-NIR PAS mostly custom-built (research labs; few commercial portable systems). Depth profiling demonstrated (paintings, murals; frequency-scanned 10 Hz - 10 kHz resolves 10-1000 μm). Limitations: slower than reflectance, requires expertise, less widespread than Raman/FTIR (fewer labs have equipment). Future: portable laser-PAS (remote, non-contact), AI-driven depth deconvolution, integration with hyperspectral imaging."
