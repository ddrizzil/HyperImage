  "summary": "Photoacoustic imaging is a hybrid non-invasive technique that combines optical excitation with acoustic detection to image subsurface structures with high resolution and penetration depth. Short laser pulses are absorbed by chromophores in the material, causing thermoelastic expansion that generates ultrasonic pressure waves. These acoustic waves are detected by ultrasound transducers and reconstructed into depth-resolved images. In cultural heritage, PAI reveals subsurface paint layers, pigment distributions, underdrawings, and structural damage beneath opaque surfaces, achieving millimeter to centimeter penetration depths impossible with purely optical techniques while maintaining sub-millimeter spatial resolution.",

    "principle": "Photoacoustic imaging exploits the photoacoustic effect: pulsed light (typically nanosecond laser pulses) is absorbed by chromophores in the material, causing rapid local heating (μs-ms timescale). This thermal expansion generates pressure waves (ultrasound) that propagate through the material. Ultrasonic transducers on the surface detect these waves. The time-of-flight of acoustic signals encodes depth information: deeper absorbers generate delayed signals. By scanning the laser beam or transducer array, 2D/3D images are reconstructed showing absorption distribution as a function of depth. PAI overcomes optical scattering limitations (only ballistic photons needed for absorption) while providing ultrasound's penetration depth and acoustic resolution.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "The photoacoustic effect involves three coupled processes: (1) Optical absorption: chromophore absorbs photon energy E = hν, transitioning to excited state. (2) Thermal relaxation: excited state decays non-radiatively to heat (thermoelastic regime: temperature rise ΔT ∝ absorbed energy). (3) Acoustic generation: rapid heating causes thermoelastic expansion, launching pressure wave p₀ ∝ Γ μₐ F, where Γ is Grüneisen parameter (material-dependent), μₐ is absorption coefficient, F is optical fluence. Key chromophores in heritage materials: carbon-based pigments (black, umber), iron oxides (red, yellow ochre), copper compounds (azurite, verdigris), organic dyes (strong visible absorption).",

Near-infrared excitation (700-1200 nm) maximizes depth due to reduced scattering. Oil paint layers: 1-3 mm typical, up to 5 mm. Tempera/gouache: 2-4 mm, less scattering than oil; better depth penetration. Canvas and wood substrates: 5-20 mm, lower absorption than paint; excellent ultrasound transmission. Varnish layers: Transparent to PAI (penetrated easily), varnish scatters light but transmits ultrasound - advantage over OCT.

Photoacoustic amplitude shown as grayscale or false color. Initial quality check: verify expected features visible.\n\n**STEP 2: Signal Processing and Enhancement**\n- Apply preprocessing: baseline subtraction, filtering, envelope detection. Adjust dynamic range for optimal visualization (log compression often used). Remove obvious artifacts (bad A-scans from poor coupling).\n\n**STEP 3: Depth Calibration**\n- Identify known features (e.g., surface, canvas-ground interface from cross-section measurements). Measure time delays. Calculate sound speed. Apply depth scaling to entire dataset.\n\n**STEP 4: Layer Identification and Segmentation**\n- Identify distinct PA features: surface peak, underdrawing layers, pigment-rich regions, delamination voids (appear as dark regions - no PA signal). Manually or automatically segment layers. Measure layer thicknesses and depths.\n\n**STEP 5: 3D Volume Rendering (If Applicable)**\n- For 3D data: reconstruct volume showing PA amplitude in 3D. Use volume rendering or isosurface extraction to visualize subsurface structures. Generate fly-through animations. Export cross-sectional slices (XY, XZ, YZ planes).\n\n**STEP 6: Multispectral Analysis (If Applicable)**\n- For spectroscopic PAI: extract PA spectrum at each pixel (PA amplitude vs. wavelength). Compare with reference spectra of known pigments. Use spectral unmixing to quantify pigment concentrations. Generate false-color maps showing pigment distributions.\n\n**STEP 7: Quantitative Measurements**\n- Measure underdrawing depth, layer thicknesses, void sizes. Calculate PA amplitude ratios between regions (indicative of absorption differences). Create depth profiles showing PA intensity vs. depth along selected lines.\n\n**STEP 8: Correlation with Other Techniques**\n- Register PAI images to XRR, IRR, OCT, or cross-section microscopy. Overlay PAI subsurface structure with surface imaging. Validate PAI depth measurements against physical cross-sections where available.",

    "interpretationGuidelines": "**PA amplitude interpretation:** Bright regions = high optical absorption (carbon black, iron oxides, copper pigments). Dark regions = low absorption (white pigments, varnish) or no signal (voids, delamination). **Depth information:** PA signal arrival time encodes depth. Earlier signals (top of A-scan) = surface; later signals = deeper layers. **Underdrawing detection:** Carbon-based underdrawings produce strong PA signal; appear as bright line/region at specific depth beneath paint layers. **Layer interfaces:** Gradual PA transitions = gradual composition change; sharp PA transitions = distinct layer boundaries. **Spectroscopic interpretation:** Wavelength-dependent PA response identifies pigments: iron oxides peak ~550 nm, azurite ~600-650 nm, carbon flat across spectrum.",
    "commonPitfalls": [
      "Assuming PA amplitude directly reflects pigment concentration: PA signal depends on absorption coefficient AND optical fluence at depth. Fluence decreases exponentially with depth due to scattering. Deep layers appear weaker even if pigment concentration is same. Correct for fluence attenuation using optical models or phantom measurements. Compare relative PA amplitudes only at similar depths. Use multispectral PAI to distinguish absorption from attenuation.",
      "Incorrect sound speed for depth scaling: Sound speed varies by material: paint ~1500-2000 m/s, wood ~3000-4000 m/s. Using wrong value causes depth errors (10% speed error → 10% depth error). Measure sound speed in known reference samples. Validate depth calibration against cross-section measurements. Use tomographic reconstruction (less sensitive to speed errors).",
      "Interpreting acoustic reverberations as real layers: Parallel interfaces (e.g., canvas-panel back) create multiple echoes at regular intervals. Can mimic real subsurface layers. Identify reverberations by equal spacing and decreasing amplitude. Compare with ultrasound pulse-echo imaging. Use broadband transducers to reduce ringing.",
      "Missing subsurface features due to shadowing: Highly absorbing layer (carbon black underdrawing) can completely block light, preventing PA generation in deeper layers. Use longer wavelengths (NIR) for better penetration. Try oblique illumination. Accept that PAI cannot image beyond opaque layers (limitation of technique).",
      "Poor acoustic coupling causing signal dropout: Air gaps between transducer and sample cause 99.9% acoustic reflection - no signal detected. Common on rough or curved surfaces. Generous gel application. Verify coupling by checking for strong surface reflection. Use conformable coupling pads for irregular surfaces. Increase transducer contact pressure (gently).",
      "Sample damage from excessive laser fluence: Laser-induced ablation, discoloration, or melting can occur above damage threshold (~30-50 mJ/cm² for many paints). Repeated exposure at same location increases risk. Always start with low fluence and increase gradually. Monitor for damage after each scan. Limit averaging to <100 shots per location. Test on mock-ups first."

Painting examined in-situ at National Gallery. Selected regions (10 × 10 cm) scanned with 200 μm step size. Ultrasound gel coupling (removable, water-soluble). Compared 532 nm (strong absorption, less depth) with 1064 nm (deeper penetration). Correlated with XRR and cross-section analysis. PAI successfully visualized carbon black underdrawing 1-2 mm beneath opaque lead white and ochre paint layers. Underdrawing contours showed figure composition changed: horse originally positioned differently (head raised higher). 1064 nm illumination penetrated 2.5 mm (reaching canvas), 532 nm limited to 1.5 mm. PAI revealed subsurface crack network invisible on surface and not detected by XRR (cracks too fine for XRR resolution but strong acoustic scatterers for PAI). Layer structure resolved: ground layer at 0.3 mm, underdrawing at 0.8 mm, paint build-up to 1.5 mm total. Delamination void (0.5 × 2 mm) detected between canvas and ground - appeared as PA signal dropout. PAI depth profiling quantitative: measured layer thicknesses matched cross-section analysis (±50 μm accuracy). Technique completely non-invasive - no sampling required unlike cross-sections. First demonstration of PAI on Old Master painting showing technique can reveal subsurface structure invisible to all other non-invasive methods.",

Compared with Raman microscopy and XRF on same regions. Validated with micro-samples analyzed by SEM-EDX. Multispectral PAI differentiated pigment layers with same surface color but different composition. Blue illumination: azurite (PA peak 630 nm) detected beneath ultramarine layer (PA peak 590 nm) - layering invisible in visible microscopy. Red illumination: vermilion underlayer (PA peak 520-600 nm broad) beneath red lake glaze (PA peak 520 nm sharp) - lake transparent to PAI, vermilion opaque. Gold leaf: PA signal at gold-parchment interface (0.1 mm depth) revealed protein-based adhesive layer (5-15 μm thickness) via PA spectrum match to collagen. Adhesive degradation mapped spatially: regions with altered PA spectrum indicated oxidized/embrittled adhesive. Depth profiling showed paint application sequence: gesso preparation (0-50 μm), gold application with adhesive (50-60 μm), pigment layers (60-200 μm). Spectroscopic PA fingerprinting identified: vermilion, red ochre, ultramarine, azurite, malachite, lead white, carbon black. Accuracy confirmed by Raman (100% agreement).
