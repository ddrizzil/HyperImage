  "summary": "Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is a highly sensitive elemental analysis technique that uses MeV-energy ion beams (typically protons or alpha particles) to excite characteristic X-rays from elements in a sample. When energetic ions collide with atoms, inner-shell electrons are ejected, and subsequent electronic transitions produce element-specific X-ray fluorescence. PIXE offers superior sensitivity (ppm-ppb detection limits) compared to electron-based techniques (SEM-EDX) due to lower background bremsstrahlung radiation, can analyze elements from Na to U simultaneously, and is essentially non-destructive for most heritage materials. In cultural heritage, PIXE enables quantitative pigment identification, provenance studies via trace element fingerprinting, and rapid multi-element mapping of paintings, ceramics, metals, and glass.",

    "principle": "PIXE exploits Coulombic interactions between energetic ions (1-4 MeV protons typical) and target atoms. The ion beam ionizes inner-shell electrons (K, L, M shells) through inelastic collisions. When outer-shell electrons transition to fill these vacancies, characteristic X-rays are emitted with energies specific to each element (e.g., Fe Kα = 6.4 keV). Protons are preferred over electrons because: (1) Higher ionization cross-section for heavy elements, (2) Minimal bremsstrahlung background (protons ~2000× heavier than electrons don't decelerate radiatively), (3) Lower detection limits (ppm vs. 0.1% for SEM-EDX). Silicon drift detector (SDD) measures X-ray energies and intensities; quantification via comparison to standards or fundamental parameters.",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "Ion-atom interaction cascade: (1) Coulombic collision: energetic proton approaches atom; electrostatic repulsion transfers energy to bound electrons. (2) Inner-shell ionization: if transferred energy exceeds binding energy (e.g., 7.1 keV for Fe K-shell), electron ejected, creating vacancy. (3) X-ray emission: outer electron transitions to fill vacancy; energy difference emitted as characteristic X-ray photon. Competing de-excitation: Auger electron emission (no X-ray). Fluorescence yield ω increases with Z: ω(K) ≈ Z⁴/(10⁶ + Z⁴); low for light elements (C, N, O difficult), high for heavy elements (excellent Fe-U). Ion energy loss in material follows Bethe-Bloch equation; protons penetrate 10-100 μm depending on energy and material density.",

Fit background model (exponential, linear, or polynomial). Subtract background from entire spectrum to isolate peaks.\n\n**STEP 3: Peak Identification**\n- Identify all peaks in spectrum by comparing energies to X-ray database. Assign element and line (K, L, M). Use characteristic peak ratios (e.g., Kα/Kβ) to confirm assignments. Be cautious of overlaps and interferences.\n\n**STEP 4: Peak Fitting and Area Integration**\n- Fit each peak with appropriate function (Gaussian + low-energy shelf + tail).

Uncertainties: √(counts) for statistical error.\n\n**STEP 5: Quantification (Standardless or Standards-Based)**\n- Convert peak areas to concentrations. Methods: (1) Fundamental parameters (requires accurate detector efficiency, beam charge, ionization cross-sections). (2) Standards-based (calibration curve from reference materials). (3) Relative quantification (peak ratios). Software like GUPIX performs full quantification.\n\n**STEP 6: Matrix Correction**\n- Account for X-ray absorption and secondary fluorescence in sample matrix. Iterative procedure: estimate composition → calculate matrix effects → adjust composition → iterate until convergence.

    "interpretationGuidelines": "**Elemental identification:** Confirm elements by multiple lines (e.g., Fe: both Kα at 6.4 keV and Kβ at 7.06 keV). Check Kα/Kβ ratios against theory. **Quantification reliability:** Major elements (>1%): accurate to ±5-10%. Trace elements (ppm): accurate to ±20-50% depending on matrix. Detection limits: 1-100 ppm for most elements. **Pigment identification:** Characteristic elemental signatures: lead white (Pb), vermilion (Hg+S), azurite (Cu), ochre (Fe), etc. Use elemental ratios and absolute concentrations. **Provenance:** Trace elements (As, Ag, Sb in lead; Au, Pt in gold; rare earths) fingerprint sources. **Matrix effects:** Light matrix (organics) vs. heavy matrix (metals) strongly affects quantification. Always correct for matrix.",
    "commonPitfalls": [
      "Peak overlap misidentification: Many X-ray lines overlap: Pb Lα (10.55 keV) and As Kα (10.54 keV) nearly identical; S Kα (2.31 keV) and Pb Mα (2.35 keV). Wrong element assignment leads to false conclusions. Check all lines of element. If As assigned based on ~10.5 keV, verify As Kβ at 11.7 keV present. Use high-resolution detector. Consult X-ray database for all possible overlaps.",
      "Ignoring matrix effects: X-ray absorption and secondary fluorescence depend on matrix composition. Lead-rich paint attenuates low-energy X-rays (Ca, K) more than organic-rich paint. Ignoring gives large quantification errors (>50%). Always use matrix-corrected quantification software (GUPIX, PyMca). Iterative calculation accounts for absorption and fluorescence. Compare to standard of similar matrix if possible.",
      "Sample charging artifacts: Insulators (paper, ceramics, glass) accumulate positive charge under ion bombardment. Deflects beam, causing spatial shifts during scanning or variable count rates. Ground sample well (conductive tape to holder). Use external beam (no vacuum, charge dissipates). Coat sample with thin carbon or gold (alters surface but prevents charging). Lower beam current.",
      "Assuming PIXE is truly non-destructive: While minimal damage in most cases, high beam currents or prolonged exposure can brown organics, melt binders, or alter sensitive pigments (Prussian blue fades). Test on mock-up samples first. Use lowest beam current giving adequate statistics. Limit exposure time. Inspect sample post-analysis for damage. Consider external beam (air cooling). Accept limitation for very sensitive materials.",
      "Over-interpreting trace elements below detection limit: Reporting element 'absent' when actually below detection limit (e.g., 10 ppm). Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence. Always report detection limits. State 'below X ppm' rather than 'not detected.' Recognize that provenance studies require measuring trace elements well above detection limits.",
      "Comparing PIXE quantification to bulk chemical analysis: PIXE probes 10-50 μm depth; bulk analysis (ICP-MS) averages entire sample. If composition varies with depth (surface enrichment, weathering), results differ. Understand PIXE samples near-surface layer only. For comparison to bulk techniques, use abraded or polished surface to access interior. Recognize complementary depth sensitivities."

        "description": "Micro-samples (~100 μg) from 15 Rembrandt paintings (ethical sampling from edge damages). PIXE analysis at 3 MeV proton beam. Measured major (Pb, O) and trace elements (Ag, Bi, As, Sb, Cu in ppm-ppb range). Complemented with LA-ICP-MS for Pb isotope ratios (²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb, ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁶Pb). Compared with historical lead white production records and lead ore databases. Analyzed 50+ samples across paintings from different periods (1630s-1660s). PIXE revealed systematic trace element patterns clustering paintings into groups. Early works (1630s): lead white with high Ag (50-200 ppm), moderate Bi (20-50 ppm), low As (<10 ppm) - consistent with German/Central European lead ores. Middle period (1640s-50s): shift to lower Ag (<30 ppm), higher As (20-80 ppm), variable Sb (10-100 ppm) - suggests English lead white (Derbyshire lead district). Later works (1660s): return to high-Ag composition but distinct Bi/Sb ratios. Remarkable finding: The Night Watch (1642) and three other paintings showed identical trace element fingerprints (Ag/Bi/As ratios within 10%) AND matching Pb isotope signatures - proves common lead white batch used across multiple major works. Trace element 'mixing lines' revealed Rembrandt sometimes mixed lead whites from different sources. Some samples showed surface Pb enrichment (5-10× higher in top 5 μm) - from lead soap formation, consistent with paint degradation studies. Detection of Cu (10-50 ppm) in lead white unexpected - traced to copper residues from lead white production (vinegar process in copper vats). One painting (previously attributed to Rembrandt) showed anomalous lead white (high Zn, low trace elements) inconsistent with 17th century production - red flag for misattribution. First comprehensive PIXE trace element study linking Rembrandt paintings via pigment provenance.",

        "title": "Celtic Gold Coin Provenance via Multi-Element PIXE",
        "description": "External beam PIXE (3 MeV protons in air) for completely non-destructive analysis. Each coin analyzed at 3-5 locations to assess homogeneity. Measured Au, Ag, Cu (major alloying elements) and traces (Pt, Pd, Sn, Fe, Ni, Zn). No sample preparation - coins analyzed 'as is' including surface patina. Acquisition: 10 min per spot, quantification via thick-target model with matrix corrections. Built compositional database of 500+ analyses. Applied multivariate statistics (PCA, hierarchical clustering) to identify compositional groups. PIXE revealed Celtic gold not pure but deliberately alloyed: Au 70-95%, Ag 2-25%, Cu 1-10%. Trace elements (ppb-ppm) varied systematically by region. Four distinct compositional clusters identified: (1) Northern Gaul: high Pt/Pd ratio (>10), low Sn (<50 ppm) - alluvial gold source. (2) Central Europe (Bohemia): low Pt (<0.5 ppm), elevated Sn (100-500 ppm) - suggests copper addition during refining. (3) Southern France: high Ag (>15%), low traces - consistent with silver-rich gold deposits. (4) Britain: intermediate composition, distinctive Pd signature. Key finding: coins from single hoard showed homogeneous composition (RSD <5% for all elements) despite varying iconography - implies centralized production. In contrast, coins from battle sites showed heterogeneous composition (RSD >30%) - warriors from different tribes. Unexpected: some 'gold' coins actually gold-plated silver (detected via extreme surface enrichment: surface Au 90%, bulk Au <10% estimated from low X-ray yield). Pb traces (5-50 ppm) correlated with cupellation refining (Pb used to remove base metals from gold). Bi/Pb ratio distinguished natural alluvial gold (Bi/Pb ~0.1) from refined gold (Bi/Pb ~1) - revealed 60% of coins used refined gold, 40% alluvial. Time trend: earlier coins (3rd century BCE) used purer gold (Au >90%); later coins (1st century BCE) progressively debased (Au declining to 70%) - economic pressure during Roman expansion. Largest systematic PIXE study of ancient coinage, establishing methodology for numismatic provenance.",
