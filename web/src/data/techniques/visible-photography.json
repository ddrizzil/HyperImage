  "summary": "High-resolution visible photography is the systematic capture of detailed digital images using visible light (400-700 nm) to create comprehensive visual documentation of cultural heritage objects, monuments, and sites. Unlike casual photography, heritage documentation employs rigorous technical standards including controlled illumination (color temperature 5000-6500K, diffuse or raking light), color-calibrated workflows (ICC profiles, color targets), high-resolution sensors (20-100+ megapixels), precise exposure control, and standardized viewing geometries to ensure accurate, reproducible records of an object's current appearance. High-resolution photography serves as the foundation for condition assessment, conservation treatment documentation, publication, digital archives, and public access, capturing surface detail (cracks, losses, texture), color (pigments, patina, degradation), and overall condition with spatial resolution from 50 μm/pixel (close-up macro) to 5 mm/pixel (architecture). Advanced techniques include focus stacking (extended depth of field), HDR imaging (expanded dynamic range), gigapixel panoramas (extremely high resolution across large objects), and photogrammetry integration (3D reconstruction from photographs). In cultural heritage, visible photography is universally applied as the primary non-contact documentation method, providing accessible visual records that complement analytical techniques while serving conservation, research, education, and public engagement needs.",

    "principle": "Photography captures the spatial distribution of light reflected from or transmitted through an object using a lens to form an image on a photosensitive detector (digital sensor or film). In digital photography, the lens focuses light onto a sensor array (typically CMOS or CCD) where photons are converted to electrons via the photoelectric effect. Each pixel (photosite) accumulates charge proportional to incident light intensity over the exposure duration. Analog-to-digital conversion yields pixel values (typically 12-16 bit raw data, 8-bit per channel for JPEG). The image represents the object's spectral reflectance convolved with: (1) illumination spectrum (light source), (2) lens transmittance, (3) sensor spectral response (filtered by Bayer pattern color filters for RGB cameras), (4) camera processing (white balance, tone curve, color space conversion). High-resolution heritage photography optimizes each factor: calibrated illumination (known color temperature), high-quality optics (low distortion, high MTF), large sensor (high pixel count, low noise), raw capture (preserve maximum information), color management (ICC profiles for accurate reproduction).",
    "physicalPhenomenon": "**Light-matter interaction:** Object surface reflects incident light based on: (1) **Spectral reflectance:** wavelength-dependent absorption/reflection determines color (e.g., red pigment absorbs blue-green, reflects red). (2) **Surface geometry:** specular reflection (mirror-like, from smooth surfaces at specific angles) vs. diffuse reflection (Lambertian, scattered in all directions from rough surfaces). (3) **Subsurface scattering:** light penetrates surface, scatters in material, emerges (important for translucent materials like marble, wax, varnish). **Image formation:** Lens (typically multi-element compound design) focuses light from object onto sensor via refraction. Focal length f determines magnification: m = image_size/object_size ≈ f/(distance - f). Aperture (f-number = f/diameter) controls depth of field (DoF, range in focus) and diffraction (resolution limit). **Sensor response:** Bayer-pattern sensor has red, green, blue filters over individual pixels (RGGB mosaic, 2× green for luminance sensitivity). Demosaicing algorithm interpolates full RGB color at each pixel. Quantum efficiency (~40-80% for modern sensors) determines sensitivity. **Dynamic range:** Sensor can capture intensity ratio from full-well capacity (saturation) to read noise floor, typically 10-14 stops (10³-10⁴:1 ratio) for modern cameras.",

For translucent materials (thin paper, textiles, alabaster, jade), light can penetrate deeper (0.1-10 mm depending on material) via subsurface scattering, emerging with modified spectrum (affects color, reveals internal structure in transmitted light photography).

Depth: No inherent depth resolution (2D imaging); depth of field determines range in acceptable focus: 1-10 mm (macro, wide aperture) to meters (architecture, stopped down aperture). Limiting factors: Sensor resolution (pixel count: 20-100 MP typical; higher = finer detail), Lens quality (MTF, aberrations; high-quality lenses resolve more detail per pixel), Diffraction (small apertures f/16-f/32 reduce resolution; optimal aperture f/8-f/11 for sharpness), Focus accuracy (critical focus required; focus stacking for extended depth of field), Camera stability (tripod essential for high-resolution; vibration/motion blur degrades sharpness), Subject distance (closer = higher resolution; limited by lens minimum focus distance and lighting).",

High dynamic range (HDR) multi-exposure: can reach 20+ stops (>10⁶:1) via bracketing and merging. Signal-to-noise: SNR >100:1 for well-exposed images (mid-tones, base ISO). SNR degrades in shadows (low signal) and at high ISO (increased noise). Modern cameras: ISO 100-400 optimal, usable up to ISO 3200-6400 with noise reduction."

Background clutter (simplify background; seamless paper or fabric; neutral color to avoid color cast). Lighting artifacts (hotspots from specular reflections; adjust light position or use polarizers)."
    ],
    "measurementProtocol": "**Step 1: Setup and Preparation**\nSelect appropriate location (studio with controlled lighting, or on-site for immovable objects/architecture). Position object on stable support, neutral background. Set up camera on tripod at appropriate distance (determine field of view, perspective). Level camera (use built-in level or hot-shoe level); ensure sensor plane parallel to object plane (perpendicular to optical axis) to avoid keystone distortion, especially critical for flat artworks (paintings, documents). For architecture: use tilt-shift lens or corrective software. Duration: 15-60 minutes (depends on object complexity, setup complexity). Critical parameters: Camera stable (tripod locked), Sensor parallel to object (minimize distortion), Background neutral and clean, Object secure and safely supported.\n\n**Step 2: Lighting Setup**\nPosition lights for even illumination: 45° angle from left and right (cross-lighting) eliminates shadows for flat documentation. For texture documentation: single light at low angle (raking light, 10-20° from surface) emphasizes relief. Adjust light distance and power to achieve even illumination (check via live view histogram or spot meter; aim for uniformity ±0.5 stop across field). Use softboxes/diffusers to avoid harsh shadows. For reflective objects: large soft sources (umbrellas, diffusion panels) or cross-polarization (polarizers on lights + camera lens) to eliminate glare. Duration: 15-45 minutes (simple setups faster; complex reflective objects require iteration). Critical parameters: Even illumination (no hotspots, shadows), Color temperature consistent (all lights same temp), Intensity adequate but not excessive (avoid overexposure), Cross-polarization if needed (for glass, varnish, metal).\n\n**Step 3: Camera Settings Configuration**\nSet camera to Manual mode (M) for full control. ISO: base ISO (100, 200, or 64 depending on camera) for maximum dynamic range and minimum noise. Aperture: f/8 to f/11 typically (optimal sharpness for most lenses, adequate depth of field for most objects). For deep 3D objects: f/16-f/22 or focus stacking. Shutter speed: determined by light level; use tripod so slow speeds (1/15 s - 2 s) acceptable. White balance: custom WB from gray card (photograph neutral gray card under same lighting, set WB from that image in camera or raw software). File format: RAW (14-bit NEF/CR3/ARW; preserves maximum information for post-processing). Image quality: highest resolution, lossless compression if available. Duration: 10-20 minutes (settings, test shots, refinement). Critical parameters: ISO at base (100-200), Aperture f/8-f/11 (optimal sharpness), RAW format (not JPEG), White balance custom (from gray card under same light).\n\n**Step 4: Focus and Composition**\nCompose image: frame object with small margin (5-10% border); include scale reference (ruler, color/gray card) in first frame or separate frame. Focus critically: use live view magnification (5× or 10×) on critical detail (center of interest, inscription, damage area). Manual focus preferred (autofocus may miss target). For shallow depth of field: focus 1/3 into depth of object (maximizes DoF front-to-back via hyperfocal principle). For very shallow DoF or 3D objects: focus stacking (see advanced techniques). Lock focus (switch lens to manual after focusing; don't touch focus ring). Check composition and edges (verify object fully in frame, parallel to edges, scale visible if included). Duration: 5-15 minutes per setup/view. Critical parameters: Critical focus (use live view magnification), Composition tight but complete (object fills frame with margin), Scale visible if required, Manual focus locked (won't drift between shots).\n\n**Step 5: Test Exposure and Histogram Check**\nCapture test image. Review histogram (RGB or luminance): ideal histogram has peak in mid-tones (center), no clipping on left (shadows) or right (highlights). Slight right-bias acceptable ('expose to the right' or ETTR: maximizes signal, minimizes noise, but avoid highlight clipping on important areas). Check for overexposure: blinking highlights (zebra pattern in playback). If clipping: reduce exposure (decrease shutter speed or increase aperture slightly, or reduce light intensity). If too dark: increase exposure. Bracket if unsure: ±1 stop (3 images at different exposures can be merged to HDR later). Check sharpness: zoom to 100% in playback, inspect critical areas. If soft: re-check focus, check for camera shake (use 2-sec self-timer or remote release to avoid vibration from shutter press). Duration: 5-10 minutes (test, review, adjust, retest). Critical parameters: Histogram optimal (no clipping, mid-tones centered), Sharp focus at 100% zoom, No camera shake (use remote release or timer), Bracketing if high contrast scene (±1 stop).\n\n**Step 6: Systematic Image Acquisition**\nCapture final images systematically: (1) Overall view (full object, scale + color target visible). (2) Details (close-ups of significant features: inscriptions, condition issues, decorative elements; maintain same lighting, change camera position/focal length to fill frame with detail). (3) Multiple angles (3D objects: front, back, sides, top; rotate object or move camera; maintain consistent lighting). (4) Raking light views (if needed for texture: low-angle single light source emphasizes surface relief; capture at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° azimuths to see all textures). (5) Transmitted light (for translucent materials: backlight with diffused light box or LED panel, photograph from front). Document: use tethered shooting (images transfer immediately to computer for review), or shoot to card and download frequently. Label files systematically (object ID, view, date, sequence number). Duration: Variable: 30 minutes for simple object (5-10 images); 2-4 hours for complex object (50-100 images including details). Critical parameters: Systematic coverage (all views, details documented), Consistent lighting and settings (for comparability across image set), Immediate review (check each image at 100% zoom for sharpness, exposure), Files labeled/organized (object ID, view descriptor in filename or metadata).\n\n**Step 7: Color Reference Capture**\nInclude color/gray target in at least one image per lighting setup (first image of series): X-Rite ColorChecker or similar positioned next to object in same plane, same lighting. Ensure target well-exposed (histogram midtones for gray patches), in focus, flat (not wrinkled or curved). This reference image enables accurate color correction in post-processing (create ICC profile or manual color balance from known target values). Optionally: capture separate reference image (target only, fills frame) for highest accuracy if target small in object images. Duration: 2-5 minutes. Critical parameters: Color target in same lighting as object, Target in focus and well-exposed, Target flat and clean (no shadows, dirt, wear on patches).\n\n**Step 8: Quality Control and Backup**\nReview all images: check histogram (exposure correct), zoom to 100% (sharpness, focus), verify coverage (all required views captured). If any issues: re-shoot immediately while setup intact. Backup: copy raw files to at least two locations (primary storage + backup drive; or computer + network storage). Verify file integrity (check file size, open a few files to confirm not corrupted). Document session: record metadata (object ID, date, photographer, camera/lens used, lighting setup notes, any special considerations) in spreadsheet or database, or in EXIF metadata fields. Duration: 15-30 minutes (review and backup for typical session). Critical parameters: All images reviewed at 100% zoom, Exposure and focus verified, Files backed up (two locations minimum), Session documented (metadata recorded).",

Apply to all images from same session. Verify neutrals appear neutral (gray card appears gray, not tinted). Software: Lightroom (color calibration panel), X-Rite ColorChecker Camera Calibration software, BasICColor.",
      "Exposure and tone adjustment: Fine-tune exposure (overall brightness), adjust highlights (recover clipped highlights if RAW headroom available), shadows (lift to reveal detail without excess noise), whites/blacks (set white/black points). Apply tone curve (S-curve for contrast, or custom for desired look). Aim: histogram well-distributed, no clipping (unless intentional in background), detail visible in all important areas. Software: Lightroom (Develop module), Photoshop (Camera Raw), Capture One.",
      "Sharpening: Apply capture sharpening (compensate for AA filter, lens softness). Use unsharp mask or modern algorithms (deconvolution sharpening in Capture One, AI sharpening in Topaz). Settings: Amount 40-80%, Radius 0.8-1.5 pixels (for typical viewing distance), Threshold ~0 for overall sharpening or ~10 to avoid amplifying noise. Apply globally or selectively (sharpen detail areas, leave smooth areas). Software: Lightroom (sharpening panel), Photoshop (Smart Sharpen, Unsharp Mask), Capture One, Topaz Sharpen AI.",
      "Noise reduction (if needed): For images with visible noise (high ISO, underexposure): apply luminance noise reduction (smooths brightness variations) and color noise reduction (removes color speckles). Balance noise reduction vs. detail preservation (aggressive NR blurs fine detail). Typically: luminance NR ~30-50, color NR ~25-40 in Lightroom scale. Alternatively: AI-based NR (Topaz DeNoise AI, DxO Prime) for better detail preservation. Software: Lightroom (detail panel), Topaz DeNoise AI, DxO PhotoLab (PRIME noise reduction).",
      "Cropping and straightening: Crop to final composition (remove extraneous background, center object, apply rule-of-thirds if artistic).

    ],
    "analysisWorkflow": "**Step 1: Image Import and Organization**\nImport RAW files into cataloging software (Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic). Organize into collections/folders by object, session date, or project. Apply initial metadata (IPTC): photographer name, copyright, caption template (object ID, institution). Cull: review all images, flag best (5-star or color label), reject out-of-focus/poorly-exposed images. Archive rejects separately (may be useful later for documentation of process or comparison).\n\n**Step 2: Color Calibration from Target**\nLocate image with color/gray target. In RAW processing software: use color target tool (Lightroom: Color Checker plugin or manual; Capture One: built-in Color Tool). Software reads target patches, compares to known values, creates camera/lighting profile or adjustment settings. Apply profile to all images from same lighting setup (batch apply via sync settings). Verify: neutral patches (gray, white, black on ColorChecker) appear neutral (no color cast), color patches approximately match visual expectation.\n\n**Step 3: Batch Adjustments (Exposure, WB, Lens Corrections)**\nSelect all images from session (or lighting setup subset). Apply lens profile correction (auto-detected from EXIF metadata: camera + lens model → corrects distortion, vignetting, chromatic aberration). Set white balance from gray card image (or from color target neutral patch). Adjust exposure if needed (small global adjustment to compensate for systematic over/under; ±0.3-0.5 stops typical). Apply to batch (sync settings across all images). Individual fine-tuning later as needed.\n\n**Step 4: Individual Image Optimization**\nFor each final-selected image (overall views, key details): fine-tune exposure and tone (histogram optimization, shadow/highlight recovery), sharpening (amount appropriate for image scale and intended use), noise reduction if needed (high ISO or underexposed areas), cropping/straightening (final composition). Verify at 100% zoom: sharpness good, noise acceptable, no artifacts (halos from oversharpening, banding from excessive adjustments). Tag/label for different uses (e.g., 'web', 'print', 'archive master').\n\n**Step 5: Export Master Files (Archival TIFFs)**\nExport final color-corrected, adjusted images as master TIFFs: 16-bit depth, Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB color space (wide gamut preserves color information), uncompressed or LZW compression (lossless), embed ICC profile. Filename: include object ID, view descriptor, date, version (e.g., '2025-001_FrontView_20250115_v01.tif'). These are archival masters (preserve maximum information for future use, re-processing, derivative generation).\n\n**Step 6: Derivative Generation (Web, Print, Display)**\nFrom master TIFFs, generate derivatives for specific uses: **Web/online:** JPEG, sRGB color space, 8-bit, ~2000-3000 px on long dimension (typical web display resolution), quality 80-90% (balance file size vs. quality), embed sRGB profile, metadata (copyright, caption). **Print:** TIFF or JPEG, Adobe RGB, 8 or 16-bit, resolution 300 ppi at final print size, unsharp mask for print sharpening, embed Adobe RGB profile. **Presentation (PowerPoint, etc.):** JPEG, sRGB, 1920×1080 px (HD) or 3840×2160 px (4K), quality 90%. **Thumbnail:** JPEG, sRGB, 200-400 px, quality 70-80%. Automate via export presets (Lightroom export settings, Photoshop actions).\n\n**Step 7: Metadata Enrichment**\nAdd comprehensive metadata to master files and/or catalog database: IPTC (caption: object title, artist, date; keywords: subject, medium, condition terms; copyright notice, photographer name, institution), EXIF (camera settings preserved from RAW), custom fields (object ID, accession number, conservation treatment reference, related images). Use controlled vocabularies (Getty AAT, TGN for consistency). Embed metadata in files (XMP sidecar or in TIFF header) and in catalog database (searchable).\n\n**Step 8: Quality Assurance and Documentation**\nReview final exports: verify file integrity (open files, check for corruption), color accuracy (view on calibrated monitor, compare to object if available or to memory/notes), resolution appropriate (zoom to 100%, verify detail level), metadata complete (all required fields populated). Generate documentation: contact sheet (thumbnail overview of session), file list with metadata, session notes (lighting setup, any issues, special techniques used). Archive raw files + masters + derivatives + documentation in repository (institutional server, RAID storage, cloud backup).",

    "interpretationGuidelines": "**Color interpretation:** Color accuracy depends on: (1) lighting spectrum (CRI >90 preferred), (2) white balance accuracy (custom WB from gray card essential), (3) monitor calibration (view on profiled display), (4) color space (Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB for masters; sRGB for web). Colors may still differ slightly from visual observation (camera spectral response ≠ human eye; metamerism effects). Document lighting used (spectral data if critical). **Detail interpretation:** Resolution limits what's visible: GSD (ground sampling distance) determines smallest feature. At 0.1 mm/pixel, features <0.2-0.3 mm (2-3 pixels) may not be resolvable (alias or disappear). Use metadata (focal length, distance) to calculate actual GSD, report with images. **Lighting interpretation:** Appearance varies with lighting: diffuse (shows color, minimal shadows) vs. raking (emphasizes texture, shadows); normal (overall view) vs. transmitted (reveals internal structure). Always document lighting technique used; avoid over-interpreting features that may be lighting artifacts.",
    "commonPitfalls": [
      "JPEG-only capture (no RAW): JPEG is 8-bit (256 tones per channel vs. 16,384 in 14-bit RAW), lossy compression (discards information), baked-in processing (white balance, tone curve cannot be fully adjusted later). Heritage requires maximum flexibility for long-term use, color accuracy, archival preservation. JPEG insufficient for serious documentation. Avoidance: ALWAYS shoot RAW for heritage documentation. RAW preserves maximum information (14-16 bit), allows full post-processing control (white balance adjustable without quality loss, highlight/shadow recovery from extended dynamic range), future-proof (can reprocess with improved algorithms). Generate JPEG derivatives from RAW for specific uses. Never discard RAW files - they are the archival originals.",
      "Uncalibrated color (no color target, no custom white balance): Auto white balance unreliable (varies with scene content; same object under same light can have different WB frame-to-frame). No color target → no objective reference → colors may be significantly inaccurate (10-20% color difference common). Unusable for scientific comparison, pigment documentation, condition assessment (color changes over time cannot be accurately tracked). Avoidance: Include color/gray target (ColorChecker) in first image of each lighting setup. Use target to set accurate white balance and create color profile in RAW processing. Apply profile to all images from that session. For critical color work: spectrophotometer-measured targets, build custom camera+lens+lighting ICC profile. Document color calibration method in metadata. Accept that perfect color match impossible (camera ≠ eye), but calibrated workflow gets close (ΔE <3-5 achievable).",
      "Poor focus / excessive depth of field compromise: Stopping down too much (f/22-f/32) to get everything in focus → diffraction degrades sharpness, negating high resolution. Or using wide aperture (f/2.8-f/4) for speed → shallow DoF, important areas out of focus. Either way: images not critically sharp across important areas. Avoidance: Use optimal aperture for lens (f/8-f/11 for most lenses: balance aberrations and diffraction). For deep objects where DoF insufficient even at f/11: use focus stacking (multiple images at different focus distances, merged in post; Helicon Focus, Photoshop, Zerene Stacker software). Do not stop down beyond f/16 unless absolutely necessary (diffraction limit at f/16 ≈ 10 μm, may exceed pixel pitch of high-res sensors, degrading effective resolution). Manual focus + live view magnification ensures critical focus on intended point.",
      "Camera shake / motion blur (no tripod, inadequate technique): Handholding camera at slow shutter speeds (1/30 s, 1/15 s) → camera movement during exposure → blurred image. High resolution cameras (45-100 MP) extremely sensitive to shake (1/focal_length rule insufficient; need 1/(2×focal_length) or faster). Even on tripod: shutter button press can cause vibration. Result: soft images that fail 100% zoom inspection (detail blurred, edges not crisp). Avoidance: ALWAYS use tripod for heritage documentation (no exceptions; even bright light where handheld seems possible, tripod ensures sharpest results). Use remote release (cable or wireless) or 2-second self-timer to avoid vibration from shutter button press. Mirror lockup (DSLR) or electronic first curtain shutter (mirrorless) reduces internal vibrations. On tripod: disable image stabilization (in lens or in-body; can cause artifacts when on stable platform). Verify sharpness: zoom to 100% on critical detail, check edges, text, fine texture crisp - if any softness, suspect shake and reshoot.",
      "Uncontrolled or mixed lighting: Photographing under mixed lighting (daylight from windows + tungsten room lights) → inconsistent color temperature across frame, difficult/impossible to correct accurately. Or photographing near sunset/sunrise → warm color casts. Or fluorescent lights → green tint. Results: inaccurate colors, color shifts across image, poor white balance correction. Avoidance: Control lighting: in studio, use all same type (LED panels, all same color temp 5000-5500K). On-site: turn off room lights if possible, use only photographic lights. Or if ambient light unavoidable: shoot during consistent time (midday overcast for diffuse natural light), avoid mixed sources. For architecture/immovable objects: shoot in consistent conditions (same time of day for exterior; consistent artificial light for interior). Always shoot RAW (white balance adjustable), use custom WB from gray card, but recognize limits (mixed lighting hard to correct perfectly; control at source is best).",
      "Over-processing / excessive manipulation: Aggressive sharpening → halos, artifacts. Excessive noise reduction → loss of fine detail, 'plastic' appearance. Extreme saturation → unnatural colors. Heavy-handed retouching → altered object appearance. For heritage: authenticity paramount; processing should enhance clarity, not alter reality. Over-processed images unacceptable for documentation, conservation records, scholarly use. Avoidance: Apply processing conservatively: sharpening just enough to compensate for slight lens softness (amount 40-60%, radius 0.8-1.2 px); noise reduction only if noise visible and problematic (luminance NR <50, detail preservation high); saturation neutral or slight reduction (heritage objects often have subtle, muted colors - do not artificially enhance). Retouching: remove only temporary artifacts (sensor dust spots, modern supports/labels if noted), never alter object itself. Before/after comparison: processing should look 'clean' not 'enhanced'. When in doubt, less is more - preserve natural appearance."
