## Overview

Metal ions, particularly transition metals like iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn), can catalyze oxidation reactions in cultural heritage materials. These metals act as redox catalysts, cycling between different oxidation states and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accelerate degradation of organic materials like oils, proteins, and cellulose. The catalytic activity is particularly problematic when metals are present as impurities or from pigments in contact with organic binders.

## Chemistry

Metal-catalyzed oxidation follows Fenton-type reactions where metal ions in lower oxidation states (Fe²⁺, Cu⁺) react with hydrogen peroxide or oxygen to generate highly reactive free radicals. These radicals then attack organic molecules, initiating chain reactions that lead to rapid degradation.

## Key Chemical Equations

**Iron-catalyzed oxidation (Fenton reaction):**
$$\mathrm{Fe^{2+} + H_2O_2 \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + OH^\bullet + OH^-}$$

**Iron-catalyzed autoxidation:**
$$\mathrm{Fe^{2+} + O_2 \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + O_2^{\cdot -}}$$

The superoxide radical (O₂⁻) can then react further:
$$\mathrm{O_2^{\cdot -} + H^+ \rightarrow HO_2^\bullet}$$
$$2\mathrm{HO_2^\bullet} \rightarrow \mathrm{H_2O_2 + O_2}$$

**Copper-catalyzed oxidation:**
$$\mathrm{Cu^+ + O_2 \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + O_2^{\cdot -}}$$
$$\mathrm{Cu^+ + H_2O_2 \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + OH^\bullet + OH^-}$$

**Manganese catalytic cycle:**
$$\mathrm{Mn^{4+} + e^- \rightarrow Mn^{3+}}$$
$$\mathrm{Mn^{3+} + O_2 \rightarrow Mn^{4+} + O_2^{\cdot -}}$$

## Aging & Degradation

Metal-catalyzed oxidation accelerates:

1. **Oil binder degradation**: Fatty acids oxidize faster, forming more cross-links and degradation products
2. **Protein hydrolysis**: Collagen and other proteins break down more rapidly
3. **Cellulose degradation**: Paper and textiles deteriorate faster
4. **Pigment-binder interactions**: Metals from pigments (e.g., lead, copper) catalyze binder oxidation

The presence of even trace amounts (ppm levels) of transition metals can significantly accelerate degradation. This is particularly problematic in:
- Iron-containing pigments (ochres, earths) in contact with organic binders
- Copper-containing pigments (azurite, malachite, verdigris) near organic materials
- Manganese in earth pigments (sienna, umber) catalyzing oxidation

## How It Is Measured

- **XRF / MA-XRF**: Maps metal distribution, identifies potential catalysts
- **ICP-MS / LA-ICP-MS**: Quantifies trace metal concentrations
- **Mössbauer Spectroscopy**: Identifies iron oxidation states (Fe²⁺ vs Fe³⁺)
- **EPR (ESR)**: Detects free radicals and paramagnetic metal ions
- **FTIR Spectroscopy**: Monitors oxidation products (C=O, O-H groups)
- **GC-MS**: Analyzes degradation products from catalyzed reactions
