## Overview

Autoxidation is the spontaneous reaction of unsaturated fatty acids in drying oils (linseed, walnut, poppy seed) with atmospheric oxygen. This process is essential for oil paint film formation, where liquid oil cross-links into a solid polymer network. The reaction proceeds via free radical chain mechanisms, initiated by light, heat, or metal catalysts, and results in the formation of hydroperoxides that decompose to form cross-linking bonds between fatty acid chains.

## Chemistry

Drying oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, linolenic acid) with multiple double bonds. The autoxidation process involves:

1. **Initiation**: Formation of free radicals from unsaturated bonds
2. **Propagation**: Chain reaction where radicals react with oxygen
3. **Termination**: Cross-linking between chains to form solid film

The primary reactive sites are the methylene groups adjacent to double bonds (allylic positions), which are particularly susceptible to hydrogen abstraction.

## Key Chemical Equations

The fundamental autoxidation reaction:

$$\text{R-CH=CH-R} + O_2 \rightarrow \text{R-CHOOH-CH-R}$$

This represents the formation of a hydroperoxide at an allylic position. The detailed mechanism involves:

**Initiation:**
$$\text{RH} \xrightarrow{h\nu, \text{heat}} \text{R}^\bullet + \text{H}^\bullet$$

**Propagation:**
$$\text{R}^\bullet + O_2 \rightarrow \text{ROO}^\bullet$$
$$\text{ROO}^\bullet + \text{RH} \rightarrow \text{ROOH} + \text{R}^\bullet$$

**Decomposition and Cross-linking:**
$$\text{ROOH} \rightarrow \text{RO}^\bullet + \text{OH}^\bullet$$
$$\text{RO}^\bullet + \text{R}^\prime\text{H} \rightarrow \text{ROR}^\prime + \text{H}^\bullet$$

## Aging & Degradation

Over time, continued autoxidation leads to:

1. **Yellowing**: Formation of chromophores from conjugated double bonds and oxidation products
2. **Embrittlement**: Excessive cross-linking makes film brittle
3. **Acid formation**: Hydroperoxide decomposition produces carboxylic acids, lowering pH
4. **Metal soap formation**: Acids react with metal ions (lead, zinc) to form soaps

The yellowing reaction involves formation of conjugated systems:

$$\text{R-CH=CH-CH}_2\text{-CH=CH-R} \xrightarrow{O_2} \text{R-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH-R}$$

These conjugated systems absorb visible light, causing yellow/brown discoloration.

## How It Is Measured

- **FTIR Spectroscopy**: Detects C=O stretching (1740 cm⁻¹) from oxidation products, O-H stretching (3400 cm⁻¹) from hydroperoxides
- **Raman Spectroscopy**: Identifies C=C bond changes, conjugated system formation
- **GC-MS / Py-GC-MS**: Analyzes fatty acid composition, identifies oxidation products (aldehydes, ketones, dicarboxylic acids)
- **UV-Vis Spectroscopy**: Measures yellowing via absorption at 400-500 nm
- **NMR**: Detects cross-linking density, identifies oxidation products
