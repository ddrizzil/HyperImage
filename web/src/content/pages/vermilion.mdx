## Overview

Vermilion is a brilliant red pigment composed of mercury sulfide (HgS) in its red α-cinnabar form. It has been used since antiquity and was one of the most expensive pigments due to the cost of mercury. Vermilion is highly opaque and provides excellent color saturation, but it is susceptible to photochemical degradation that can cause darkening or blackening, particularly when exposed to light in the presence of chloride ions.

## Chemistry

Vermilion exists in two crystalline forms:
- **α-HgS (cinnabar)**: Red, trigonal structure, stable at room temperature
- **β-HgS (metacinnabar)**: Black, cubic structure, stable above 344°C

The red form (α-HgS) is the desired pigment. It has a bandgap that makes it sensitive to light, especially in the presence of halides. The crystal structure consists of linear S-Hg-S units arranged in a helical chain.

## Key Chemical Equations

**Formation (from mercury and sulfur):**
$$\text{Hg} + \text{S} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \alpha\text{-HgS}$$

**Natural formation (cinnabar ore):**
$$\text{Hg}^{2+} + \text{S}^{2-} \rightarrow \alpha\text{-HgS}$$

## Aging & Degradation

**Light-induced transformation to metacinnabar:**
$$\alpha\text{-HgS} \xrightarrow{h\nu} \beta\text{-HgS}$$

This phase transition causes darkening. The reaction is accelerated by:
- High light intensity
- Presence of chloride ions
- Elevated temperature

**Photochemical decomposition:**
Under strong illumination, vermilion can decompose:

$$\text{HgS} \xrightarrow{h\nu} \text{Hg} + \text{S}$$

This produces metallic mercury (liquid droplets) and elemental sulfur, causing both darkening and potential health hazards.

**Chloride-induced degradation:**
In the presence of Cl⁻ ions (from air pollution, cleaning agents, or underlying layers), vermilion can form gray/black compounds:

$$\alpha\text{-HgS} + \text{Cl}^- \xrightarrow{h\nu} \text{Hg}_2\text{Cl}_2 + \text{S}$$

or more complex phases like corderoite (Hg₃S₂Cl₂).

## How It Is Measured

- **Raman Spectroscopy**: Characteristic peaks at 254, 284, 344 cm⁻¹ for α-HgS; different pattern for β-HgS
- **XRF / MA-XRF**: Detects mercury (Hg) and sulfur (S) distribution
- **XRD**: Distinguishes α-HgS (trigonal) from β-HgS (cubic)
- **Micro-Raman**: Identifies degradation products at grain boundaries (see [Micro-Raman Spectroscopy](/techniques/micro-raman-spectroscopy))
- **SEM-EDS**: Morphology and elemental analysis
- **UV-Vis Reflectance**: Color change monitoring
