## Overview

Yellow ochre is an earth pigment composed primarily of goethite (α-FeO(OH)), a hydrated iron oxide. It has been used since prehistoric times and is one of the most stable and permanent pigments. Yellow ochre provides warm yellow tones and is often used for flesh tones, landscapes, and underpainting. The pigment can transform to red ochre (hematite) upon heating, a process used to create "burnt" ochre variants.

## Chemistry

Goethite has the chemical formula FeO(OH) or α-FeO(OH), with iron in the +3 oxidation state. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with chains of FeO₆ octahedra sharing edges. The yellow color comes from charge transfer transitions involving Fe³⁺ ions. Goethite is stable under normal conditions but dehydrates to hematite (Fe₂O₃) when heated above ~200°C.

## Key Chemical Equations

**Formation (natural weathering):**
$$\mathrm{Fe^{2+} + O_2 + H_2O \rightarrow FeO(OH) + H^+}$$

**Dehydration to hematite:**
$$2\mathrm{FeO(OH)} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{Fe_2O_3 + H_2O}$$

This reaction occurs during firing/burning of ochre to create redder tones.

**Oxidation of ferrous iron:**
$$\mathrm{4Fe^{2+} + O_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow 4FeO(OH) + 8H^+}$$

## Aging & Degradation

Yellow ochre is extremely stable and shows minimal degradation under normal conditions. However:

1. **Thermal transformation**: Heating converts goethite to hematite (red ochre), which is irreversible
2. **Acid attack**: Strong acids can dissolve goethite:
   $$\mathrm{FeO(OH) + 3H^+ \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + 2H_2O}$$
3. **Reduction**: Under anaerobic conditions with reducing agents, goethite can be reduced:
   $$\mathrm{FeO(OH) + H_2 \rightarrow FeO + H_2O}$$

The iron in goethite can also catalyze oxidation of organic binders (see [Metal-catalyzed oxidation](/pages/metal-catalyzed-oxidation)).

## How It Is Measured

- **Raman Spectroscopy**: Characteristic peaks at 300, 385, 550 cm⁻¹ for goethite
- **XRF / MA-XRF**: Detects iron (Fe) distribution
- **XRD**: Identifies goethite crystal structure (distinguishes from other iron oxides)
- **Mössbauer Spectroscopy**: Confirms Fe³⁺ oxidation state, distinguishes goethite from hematite
- **FTIR Spectroscopy**: O-H stretching bands at 3100-3400 cm⁻¹, Fe-O bands
- **UV-Vis Reflectance**: Color measurement, distinguishes from other yellow pigments
