## Overview

Lead white, also known as basic lead carbonate (2PbCO₃·Pb(OH)₂ or hydrocerussite), is one of the most important white pigments in art history, used from antiquity through the 20th century. It provides excellent opacity, good handling properties, and dries quickly in oil media. However, it is highly toxic and susceptible to darkening when exposed to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) from air pollution or biological sources, forming black lead sulfide (PbS).

## Chemistry

Lead white has the chemical formula 2PbCO₃·Pb(OH)₂, consisting of two carbonate groups and one hydroxide group coordinated to lead. The structure is a layered mineral (hydrocerussite) with lead in +2 oxidation state. It is insoluble in water but soluble in acids, forming lead salts. The pigment is typically produced by exposing lead metal to acetic acid vapor and carbon dioxide, or by electrolytic methods.

## Key Chemical Equations

**Formation (traditional method):**
$$2\text{Pb} + 2\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + O_2 + CO_2 \rightarrow 2\text{PbCO}_3 \cdot \text{Pb(OH)}_2$$

**Reaction with acids:**
$$2\text{PbCO}_3 \cdot \text{Pb(OH)}_2 + 6\text{H}^+ \rightarrow 3\text{Pb}^{2+} + 2\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

## Aging & Degradation

The primary degradation pathway is **blackening** via reaction with hydrogen sulfide:

$$2\text{PbCO}_3 \cdot \text{Pb(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow 3\text{PbS} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 2\text{CO}_2$$

This reaction occurs when:
- Air pollution contains H₂S (industrial areas, near volcanoes)
- Biological activity produces H₂S (bacteria in damp conditions)
- Varnishes or other materials release sulfur compounds

The black PbS can sometimes be reversed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide:

$$\text{PbS} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{PbSO}_4 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Oxidation to lead oxides:**
Under certain conditions, lead white can oxidize:

$$2\text{PbCO}_3 \cdot \text{Pb(OH)}_2 + O_2 \rightarrow \text{PbO}_2 + CO_2 + H_2O$$

**Metal soap formation:**
Lead white reacts with fatty acids from oil binders:

$$\text{Pb}^{2+} + 2 \text{RCOO}^- \rightarrow \text{Pb(RCOO)}_2$$

These lead soaps can cause protrusions, transparency, and other condition issues.
