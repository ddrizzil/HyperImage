Carrier gas (He or H₂) sweeps vaporized sample through long capillary column (15-60 m, 0.25 mm ID) coated with stationary phase (polymeric liquid film, 0.1-1 μm thick). Temperature programmed ramping (50-350°C over 20-60 min) causes compounds to partition between mobile (gas) and stationary phases based on volatility, polarity, and molecular interactions. Compounds elute at characteristic retention times determined by their physicochemical properties. (2) Mass Spectrometry: eluting compounds enter MS ion source where electron impact (EI, 70 eV electrons) or chemical ionization (CI) fragments molecules into characteristic ion patterns. Ions accelerated and separated by mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in quadrupole, time-of-flight, or ion trap analyzer. Detector counts ions at each m/z, generating mass spectrum (intensity vs. m/z). Unique fragmentation pattern serves as molecular fingerprint for identification via library matching.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nNot applicable (GC-MS is analytical detector, not radiation source).

Inlet temperature: 250-350°C (splitless or split injection). Carrier gas flow: 1-2 mL/min (constant flow or constant pressure mode). Injection volume: 0.5-2 μL (solution in volatile solvent). MS ionization: electron impact (EI) uses 70 eV electrons; chemical ionization (CI) uses lower-energy ion-molecule reactions. Inlet heater: 100-500 W; column oven: 1-3 kW; MS ion source: <100 W. N/A (chemical separation + ionization technique, not electromagnetic radiation-based).\n\n**Detector:**\nQuadrupole mass analyzer + electron multiplier detector (most common), Time-of-flight (TOF) MS (high resolution, exact mass), Ion trap MS (MSⁿ capability for structure elucidation), or Magnetic sector (high resolution, less common now). Mass range: m/z 10-1000 amu typical (quadrupole); 50-1500 amu extended range; TOF can reach 10,000+ amu. Electron multiplier gain 10⁵-10⁶ (single ion detection possible); overall efficiency ~0.01% (losses in ion source, analyzer, detector). Scan speed: 1-10 scans/second (quadrupole); TOF: 10-100 Hz (faster for transient peaks).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Capillary column (stationary phase chemistry determines selectivity: nonpolar 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane most common; polar polyethylene glycol for alcohols, acids)\n- MS ion source (electron impact at 70 eV standard for library matching; must be clean, stable emission)\n- Vacuum system (maintain <10⁻⁵ Torr; turbopump must function reliably; leaks catastrophic)\n- Electron multiplier detector (degrades over time; periodic replacement needed; gain must be calibrated)\n- Inlet septa and liners (consumables; septa pierced by syringe needle, degrade with use; liners collect non-volatile residues)\n- Carrier gas supply (ultra-high purity He or H₂; moisture/O₂ <1 ppm; contaminants damage column)\n- Data system with spectral libraries (NIST, Wiley libraries essential for identification; >300,000 spectra)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard heritage GC-MS:** Agilent 7890B GC coupled to 5977B quadrupole MS. Capillary column: HP-5MS (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film). Injector: split/splitless, 280°C. Injection: 1 μL, splitless mode (30 s valve time).

Autosampler: 100-vial capacity for batch analysis.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: No inherent spatial resolution (bulk technique); can sample discrete areas (1-2 mg each) for pseudo-spatial mapping. Depth Resolution: No depth resolution (bulk homogenized sample). Limiting factors: Sample size: 1-10 mg typical (sets minimum sampling area for thin materials), Homogenization: grinding/dissolution averages composition across sample, Sensitivity: trace components detectable, but sampling from specific locations may not provide sufficient material, Contamination: small sample size means surface contaminants can dominate signal.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nGC-MS is a bulk molecular analysis technique requiring sample extraction and dissolution. It provides no spatial information - entire sample (typically 1-2 mg) is homogenized, extracted, derivatized if needed, and analyzed as a mixture. Technique identifies molecules, not their original location in object. For spatial information, must combine with microscopy (sample discrete areas separately) or use complementary techniques (Raman mapping, FTIR imaging). Binding media (oils, resins, waxes): Bulk sample (no depth dimension), extract fatty acids, terpenes, wax components; identifies material type. Natural dyes: Bulk extraction from fibers, extract anthraquinones, flavonoids, indigoids; identifies plant/animal source. Proteins (glues, egg): Bulk hydrolysis → amino acids, amino acid profile identifies protein source (collagen, albumin, casein). Archaeological residues: Bulk pottery sherd or soil sample, lipid biomarkers reveal contents (animal fats, plant oils, beeswax). Degradation products: Surface scraping or bulk sample, identifies oxidation products (azelaic acid from oils), photo-degradation markers.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nLow pg (picogram, 10⁻¹² g) on-column for sensitive compounds (hydrocarbons, PAHs). Practical sample level: ng-μg per component in 1-2 mg sample (ppb-ppm range). Dynamic range: 10⁴-10⁶ (linear detector response over 4-6 orders of magnitude); can detect major components (>10%) and trace contaminants (<0.01%) in same run. Signal-to-noise: SNR >100:1 for major peaks typical; detection threshold usually SNR 3:1 (limit of detection) to 10:1 (limit of quantification).', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** micro-destructive\n\n**Portability:** laboratory-based\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Sampling required: Yes - 1-10 mg typical (often 1-2 mg sufficient for binding media, oils, resins); 5-20 mg for dyes (low concentration in fibers); 10-50 mg for archaeological residues (low organic content)', 'Not applicable (samples processed in solution, not mounted).

Weekly: inject n-alkane ladder (verify retention times, column performance). Monthly: inject FAME standard mix (verify quantification accuracy, response factors). Annually: full system recalibration (retention index database update, response factor determination for key analytes).\n\n**Procedure:** MS autotune: software automatically adjusts ion source voltages, quadrupole voltages, detector gain to optimize sensitivity and mass accuracy. Inject PFTBA (perfluorotributylamine), acquire spectrum, compare to target ions (m/z 69, 219, 502). Adjust until match within ±0.5 amu, peak ratios within 10%. Retention index calibration: inject n-alkane mix (C10-C40), determine retention times, calculate retention indices for unknown peaks via interpolation (Kovats index). Response factor determination: inject authentic standards at known concentrations (3-5 levels spanning expected sample range), plot peak area vs. concentration, determine slope (response factor) for each compound.']}, 'data_outputs': '**Raw Data Format:**\n**File Formats:** Vendor-specific binary formats: .D (Agilent MassHunter), .RAW (Thermo Xcalibur), .QGD (Shimadzu LabSolutions), Open formats: netCDF (.CDF), mzML, mzXML (vendor-neutral, for interchange), ASCII export: .CSV for peak tables, chromatograms.\n\n**Data Structure:** 3D data: intensity = f(retention time, m/z).

Software fits polynomial or moving average through valleys between peaks, subtracts from signal. Improves integration accuracy. Software: Built into all vendor software (MassHunter, Xcalibur, LabSolutions); manual adjustment if needed\n- Peak detection and integration: Automatic peak finding: software uses threshold (e.g., 5× baseline noise) and slope criteria to detect peak start/end. Fits Gaussian or exponential modified Gaussian (EMG) to peak shape. Calculates area (integration) and height. Manual review required for: co-eluting peaks (manual baseline draw), shoulder peaks, poor baseline separation. Software: Vendor software (Agilent, Thermo, Shimadzu); AMDIS (free, NIST) for deconvolution\n- Spectral deconvolution: Separate overlapping peaks (co-elution): AMDIS or similar software uses maximum entropy or other algorithms to extract 'pure' component spectra from mixed spectra. Improves library match quality when chromatographic resolution inadequate. Software: AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System, free from NIST)\n- Retention index calculation: Convert retention times to retention indices (Kovats index, dimensionless) using n-alkane ladder. RI = 100n + 100(log t_R - log t_R(n)) / (log t_R(n+1) - log t_R(n)), where n is carbon number of alkane eluting before analyte, t_R times. RI more robust than absolute retention time (independent of flow rate variations). Software: AMDIS, vendor software (some), or manual calculation (Excel, Python)\n- Internal standard normalization: Normalize all peak areas to internal standard peak area: A_normalized = A_peak / A_IS × C_IS. Corrects for injection volume variation, sample prep losses, detector response drift. Software: Manual calculation (Excel) or quantitation software module", 'analysis_workflow': "**STEP 1: Visual Inspection of TIC Chromatogram**\n- Open data file. Display TIC (total ion current vs. retention time). Assess chromatogram quality: baseline stable? Peaks well-separated? Internal standard present? Solvent peak shape normal? Overall appearance consistent with expected material (e.g., binding oil should show cluster of FAMEs at 15-25 min; protein should show amino acid TMS derivatives at 10-20 min). Flag anomalies (very noisy, no peaks, unexpected profile).\n\n**STEP 2: Automatic Peak Integration**\n- Run automatic integration algorithm. Software detects peaks, assigns baselines, calculates areas/heights. Review integration: zoom into each peak region, verify baseline placement reasonable, no missed peaks or false positives. Manually integrate problem areas (co-eluting peaks: draw manual baseline; shoulder peaks: split peak into components; broad baseline hump: integrate separately from sharp peaks).\n\n**STEP 3: Tentative Identification via Library Search**\n- For each major peak (area >0.5-1% of total): extract mass spectrum (average over peak apex ±0.05 min). Perform library search (NIST, Wiley). Examine top 10 matches. Select best match based on: (1) Match quality score (>850 preferred), (2) Molecular ion presence (highest m/z, confirms MW), (3) Major fragment ions consistent, (4) Retention time/index consistent with literature (if known). Record tentative ID, match quality, molecular weight. For unknowns with poor match (<700): attempt manual interpretation (fragmentation pattern analysis) or defer identification (report as 'unknown, M⁺ = X').\n\n**STEP 4: Confirmation with Retention Index**\n- Calculate retention indices for identified peaks (requires n-alkane calibration run). Compare calculated RI to literature values (published RI databases for common heritage materials: NIST WebBook, peer-reviewed papers). Good agreement (ΔRI < 20 units, ideally <10) confirms identification. Discrepancy (ΔRI >50): re-evaluate library match (may be isomer or incorrect ID).\n\n**STEP 5: Quantification (if required)**\n- For quantitative analysis: integrate target peaks and internal standard peak. Calculate concentration: C = (A_peak / A_IS) × C_IS × (1/RF), where RF = response factor from calibration curve (or assume RF = 1 if no calibration available, semi-quantitative). Express as μg analyte per mg sample, or % by weight. For relative quantification (no absolute calibration): normalize all peak areas to 100%, report composition as percentages (useful for binding media characterization: % palmitic, % stearic, % oleic, etc.).\n\n**STEP 6: Material Type Determination**\n- Integrate interpretation: based on identified compounds, determine material type. **Binding media:** Fatty acid profile (FAME ratios) indicates oil type: linseed (high linolenic C18:3), walnut/poppy (high linoleic C18:2), egg (low C18:3). Resin components (abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid → conifer resin; sandaracopimaric acid → pine resin). Wax (long-chain esters C40-C50, long-chain alcohols/acids C24-C34 → beeswax, carnauba, etc.). **Proteins:** Amino acid profile: high hydroxyproline → collagen (animal glue); high glycine + alanine → silk; glutamic + aspartic rich → casein (milk). **Dyes:** Specific marker compounds: indigotin + isatin → indigo; alizarin + purpurin → madder; carminic acid → cochineal. Consult reference literature for definitive identifications (Colombini & Modugno 'Organic Mass Spectrometry in Art and Archaeology' essential reference).\n\n**STEP 7: Degradation Assessment**\n- Identify degradation markers: **Oxidation products:** azelaic acid (C9 diacid, from oxidative cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids C18:1, C18:2 → indicates oil degradation/aging). Suberic acid (C8 diacid), sebacic acid (C10 diacid) also oxidation products. High azelaic/palmitic ratio (A/P > 1) = extensive oxidation (aged painting, outdoor exposure). **Depolymerization:** short-chain products from polymer degradation (e.g., furans from cellulose, pyrroles from proteins). **Photo-degradation:** specific markers depend on material (e.g., oxalic acid from cellulose, formyl-kynurenine from proteins).\n\n**STEP 8: Report Generation**\n- Compile results into report. Include: (1) Sample information (ID, object, location sampled, mass). (2) Methods summary (derivatization procedure, GC-MS parameters). (3) Results table (identified compounds, retention times, match quality, relative %, quantitative results if applicable). (4) TIC chromatogram figure (annotated with major peak IDs). (5) Representative mass spectra (3-5 key compounds). (6) Interpretation (material type, condition, degradation). (7) References (for identification, comparison data).

ubiquitous contaminants, Siloxanes - cyclic siloxanes (D4, D5, D6) from column bleed (stationary phase degradation at high temperature), Fatty acids from handling - palmitic, stearic, oleic acids (skin oils); C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 in blanks indicate contamination, Solvent impurities - peaks in solvent blank (esp. if not GC-MS grade); compare all sample peaks to blank, Derivatization byproducts - e.g., trimethylsilanol (TMS-OH) from BSTFA silylation; methyl palmitate in transesterification reagent, Septum bleed - siloxanes, plasticizers from inlet septum degradation (replace septa every 50-100 injections), Column bleed - baseline rise at high temperature, siloxane peaks; normal but indicates column aging (replace if excessive)', 'Troubleshooting: No peaks detected (TIC flat) (check autosampler operation (manual injection test); verify MS vacuum on, filament on; check inlet pressure (should be 10-20 psi); replace inlet liner if clogged; cut off contaminated column end (0.5 m) and reinstall), Internal standard peak absent or very small (verify IS added (check prep log); increase injection volume to 1-2 μL; use fresh IS stock; increase inlet temperature (+20°C) for high-BP IS; use splitless injection for trace IS), Very poor peak shape (broad, tailing) (replace column (if >500 injections or >2 years old); replace inlet liner (every 20-50 injections); dilute sample 10× and re-inject; deactivate inlet liner (silanize) or use deactivated liner; bake column at max temp (320°C) for 2 hours to remove contaminants), Retention times shift between runs (>0.2 min) (check carrier gas cylinder (low pressure causes flow drop); verify oven temperature accuracy with calibrated thermometer; re-measure column length, update method; run n-alkane standard, update retention index calibration), Library match quality poor (<700) even for known compounds (perform MS autotune (PFTBA);
