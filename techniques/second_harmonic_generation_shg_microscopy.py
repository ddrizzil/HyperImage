In cultural heritage, SHG provides molecular-level structural information about fibrillar proteins (collagen in parchment, sizing), crystalline pigments with broken symmetry, and cellulose fiber orientation in paper and canvas, all without fluorescent labeling or staining. The technique offers intrinsic 3D sectioning capability and minimal photodamage due to near-infrared excitation.', 'abstract': 'Second harmonic generation microscopy is a label-free nonlinear optical technique that generates contrast from non-centrosymmetric molecular structures by converting two incident photons of frequency ω into a single photon at frequency 2ω. In cultural heritage, SHG provides molecular-level structural information about fibrillar proteins (collagen in parchment, sizing), crystalline pigments with broken symmetry, and cellulose fiber orientation in paper and canvas, all without fluorescent labeling or staining. The technique offers intrinsic 3D sectioning capability and minimal photodamage due to near-infrared excitation.', 'physics_principle': 'SHG is a second-order nonlinear optical process where two photons of the same frequency (ω) interact simultaneously with a non-centrosymmetric material to generate a single photon at exactly twice the frequency (2ω, half the wavelength). Unlike fluorescence, SHG is a parametric process - no energy is absorbed, making it inherently non-destructive. The process is coherent (phase-matched), instantaneous (femtosecond response), and highly specific to ordered, non-centrosymmetric structures. The SHG signal intensity scales as the square of the incident intensity, requiring high peak powers achievable with femtosecond pulsed lasers. In biological and heritage materials, collagen fibrils, cellulose crystallites, and certain pigment crystals are the primary SHG sources.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nMode-locked femtosecond pulsed laser (Ti:Sapphire or fiber laser). 80-100 MHz repetition rate; 100-200 fs pulse duration; tunable 700-1000 nm. Excitation: 700-1000 nm (NIR); typical 800 nm for collagen, 880 nm for cellulose. Average power at sample: 5-50 mW (peak power: 5-50 kW due to short pulses). Gaussian TEM₀₀ mode; linearly or circularly polarized; <1 nm bandwidth.\n\n**Detector:**\nPhotomultiplier tube (PMT), Hybrid detector (GaAsP), or Electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) for widefield. Sensitive to 350-650 nm (second harmonic is in visible range). Efficiency: PMT 20-40% QE at SHG wavelengths; Hybrid 40-60% QE. Time resolution: Nanosecond for photon counting mode; gated detection to reduce background.\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Femtosecond laser with power stability <1% RMS\n- High-NA objective lens (oil immersion 60×/1.4 NA or water immersion 60×/1.2 NA)\n- Short-pass dichroic beamsplitter (reflects NIR, transmits visible SHG)\n- Narrow bandpass filter centered at λ_exc/2 (e.g., 400 ± 10 nm for 800 nm excitation)\n- Non-descanned detection path (PMT close to objective for maximum collection)\n- Motorized Z-stage for 3D sectioning (nanometer precision)\n- Environmental chamber (maintain humidity for hydrated biological samples)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard SHG microscope:** Upright or inverted laser-scanning confocal platform adapted for multiphoton imaging. Ti:Sapphire laser (800 nm, 100 fs, 80 MHz) coupled to scan head. Sample on motorized stage with Z-piezo. Epi-detection: PMT positioned after objective, before scan mirrors (non-descanned). Forward detection (F-SHG): transmission PMT with condenser lens below sample. Bandpass filter 390-410 nm for 800 nm excitation. Image acquisition: 512 × 512 pixels at 1-10 Hz frame rate.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 0.3-0.5 μm (diffraction-limited; depends on NA and excitation wavelength ~800 nm). Depth Resolution: 0.8-2 μm axial resolution (intrinsic 3D sectioning from nonlinear excitation). Limiting factors: Numerical aperture of objective (higher NA = better resolution), Excitation wavelength (NIR: 700-1000 nm typical), Scattering in sample (reduces resolution at depth), Pulse width (femtosecond pulses required for nonlinear process), Signal-to-noise ratio at low SHG signals.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nSHG penetration depth depends on NIR excitation light scattering in the sample. Typical imaging depth is 50-200 μm in biological tissues; deeper in transparent materials. Forward-detected SHG (F-SHG) probes thicker samples than backward (epi-detected) SHG. Depth is limited by scattering of NIR light and absorption at visible SHG wavelength during detection. Collagen (parchment, leather): 50-150 μm typical, excellent signal from fibrillar collagen; depth limited by scattering. Canvas (sized with animal glue): 20-80 μm into fibers, SHG from collagen sizing penetrating fiber surfaces. Paper (cellulose fibers): 30-100 μm, crystalline cellulose produces SHG; oriented fibers give strong signal. Paint cross-sections: 100-300 μm, can image through transparent layers to detect pigment crystals. Pigment particles (crystalline): Surface to ~50 μm, strong SHG from non-centrosymmetric crystals like cinnabar.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nSingle collagen fibril detectable (~100 nm diameter); minimum organized molecular ensemble ~10³-10⁴ molecules. Dynamic range: 10³-10⁴ (limited by detector dynamic range and laser power range). Signal-to-noise: SNR 20-100:1 for collagen in typical samples; lower for weakly SHG-active materials.', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** laboratory-only\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Sampling required: 50 μm - 1 mm thickness ideal; micro-samples or cross-sections', 'Mount sample on glass coverslip or slide.
