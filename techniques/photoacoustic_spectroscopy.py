photoacoustic_spectroscopy_data = {'one_line_summary': 'Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is a photothermal technique that detects absorbed light by measuring acoustic waves generated when modulated radiation heats a sample. Chopped or pulsed light (UV-Vis-NIR, 200-2500 nm typical) irradiates the sample; absorbed photons convert to heat via non-radiative relaxation; periodic heating causes thermal expansion generating pressure waves (ultrasound, 10 Hz - 10 MHz) detected by microphone or piezoelectric transducer. The photoacoustic signal amplitude versus wavelength yields an absorption spectrum revealing electronic and vibrational transitions. Unlike conventional transmission/reflectance spectroscopy, PAS directly measures absorption (not affected by scattering), penetrates opaque materials (depth-profiling via modulation frequency: 10 Hz → mm-scale, 10 kHz → μm-scale), and requires no sample preparation. Heritage applications include non-destructive pigment identification in paintings, subsurface layer detection through paint/varnish, photodegradation monitoring, and analysis of highly scattering materials (powders, textiles, paper) where conventional spectroscopy fails.', 'abstract': 'Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is a photothermal technique that detects absorbed light by measuring acoustic waves generated when modulated radiation heats a sample.

Low frequency (10-100 Hz) → thermal diffusion length 200-1000 μm (probes bulk, subsurface layers). High frequency (1-100 kHz) → 1-20 μm (surface-sensitive, top paint layer). Intermediate frequency → intermediate depths. Thermal wave attenuates exponentially: signal from depth z ∝ exp(-z/μ_th).\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nAbsorption coefficient β ~ 10⁻⁴ cm⁻¹ detectable (very weakly absorbing materials). Major component: 0.1-1 wt%. Trace: 100-1000 ppm with signal averaging.", 'sample_requirements': '**Destructiveness:** non-destructive (typically; low power density avoids heating damage; <10 mW/cm²)\n\n**Portability:** benchtop to portable (lab systems 0.5×1 m; fiber-coupled portable PAS under development)\n\n**Sample Size:** Micro-sample (mg-scale) or in situ (paintings, textiles analyzed directly). PA cell accommodates 5-20 mm diameter sample (disk, powder, or object surface if accessible).\n\n**Mounting Procedure:**\nGas-cell PAS: place sample flat in cell chamber (powder pressed lightly or loose; solid fragment on holder).

Rough, curved, powdered surfaces acceptable. Dust/contamination on surface contributes to signal (may need cleaning if surface layer not of interest).'], 'data_collection': ['System Setup and Calibration: Turn on lamp (warm 15-30 min for spectral stability). Calibrate wavelength (use emission line standards: Hg, Ar lamps; verify monochromator at known lines ±1 nm). Set chopper frequency (20-200 Hz typical for paintings, 100-1000 Hz for surface-sensitive). Tune lock-in amplifier (time constant 100 ms - 1 s, phase adjustment for maximum signal on reference absorber like carbon black).', 'Sample Loading and Cell Preparation: Mount sample in PA cell (flat against window for gas-cell; powder lightly pressed). Seal cell, purge with He (5-10 min, flow rate 50-100 mL/min, vent to exhaust). Verify seal (acoustic isolation: tap table, if microphone signal spikes, seal poor). Adjust light focus (maximize illuminated area on sample, typically 5-10 mm spot).', "Reference Spectrum Acquisition: Acquire PA spectrum of reference absorber (carbon black powder, or instrument's internal reference). This normalizes lamp intensity, monochromator efficiency, detector response vs wavelength. Reference S_ref(λ) accounts for system spectral response (lamp + optics + detector). Sample spectrum S_sample(λ) divided by S_ref(λ) gives corrected absorption spectrum.", 'Sample Spectrum Acquisition: Scan wavelength (UV-Vis-NIR: 200-800 nm or 400-2500 nm, step size 5 nm typical). At each wavelength: lock-in integrates signal for t_int (0.3-3 s, longer for low-absorbing samples or better SNR). Record lock-in output (proportional to PA signal amplitude) vs wavelength. Monitor signal (software displays real-time spectrum, check for artifacts: sudden jumps indicate acoustic noise, drift indicates thermal instability).', 'Depth Profiling (Optional): To probe different depths: repeat spectrum at multiple chopper frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz, 100 Hz, 500 Hz, 2000 Hz). Low frequency → deeper; high frequency → surface. Each frequency gives spectrum weighted toward corresponding depth. Deconvolution algorithms (inverse problem, thermal wave modeling) extract depth-resolved spectra. Requires expertise, specialized software. Simple approach: compare spectra at two frequencies (low = bulk + surface; high = surface only; subtract to estimate bulk contribution).', 'Data Processing and Quality Control: Normalize sample spectrum: A_norm(λ) = S_sample(λ) / S_ref(λ). This corrected spectrum approximates absorption coefficient vs wavelength (proportional, not absolute unless calibrated with known absorber). Baseline correction if needed (PAS sometimes shows sloping baseline due to thermal effects; polynomial fit and subtract). Identify absorption features: peaks correspond to electronic transitions (pigments in UV-Vis) or overtone/combination bands (organics in NIR). Compare to reference spectra (databases, literature). Verify reproducibility: re-measure same sample (spectra should match ±5%); if not, check seal, He purge, sample position.'], 'calibration': ['Standards: Carbon black powder (broadband absorber, flat spectrum UV-Vis-NIR; used as reference to normalize system response), Colored glass filters (Schott, Hoya): known absorption peaks, verify wavelength accuracy ±2 nm, Holmium oxide (Ho₂O₃) glass: sharp peaks at 241, 287, 361, 418, 453, 536, 640 nm (UV-Vis wavelength calibration), Polystyrene film (NIR): C-H overtone bands 1680, 1728, 1760 nm (verify NIR calibration)', 'Wavelength calibration: place Ho₂O₃ glass in PA cell, acquire spectrum, identify peaks, compare to known positions (e.g., 536 nm peak).

Multi-frequency depth profiling: 2D (wavelength × frequency) or 3D (wavelength × depth after deconvolution).', 'data_analysis_pipeline': {'preprocessing': '- Normalization\n- Baseline correction\n- Smoothing\n- Wavelength-to-wavenumber conversion (for FTIR-PAS)\n- Derivative spectra (optional)', 'analysis_workflow': '1. Visual Inspection: Plot normalized spectrum. Identify major peaks, shoulders, overall shape. Note wavelength ranges of absorption (e.g., visible pigment peaks 400-700 nm, NIR organic overtones 1400-1800 nm). Check for artifacts (spikes, unusual baseline).\n2. Peak Identification: List peak wavelengths (maxima). Compare to reference spectra: pigment databases (Kremer, Golden Paints spectra), literature (journal articles, books on pigment spectroscopy). Assign peaks to electronic/vibrational transitions (e.g., 490 nm = vermilion, 590 nm = minium, 1720 nm = C-H overtone in oil).\n3. Quantitative Analysis (optional): Peak area/intensity ratios for mixture quantification (semi-quantitative; need calibration with known mixtures for accuracy). Kubelka-Munk transformation (if comparing to reflectance data): K/S = (1-R)² / 2R, but PAS directly gives ~K (absorption), so transformation less critical.\n4. Depth Profiling Analysis: If multi-frequency data: plot spectra at each frequency. Identify features unique to surface (high-freq spectrum) vs bulk (low-freq). Deconvolution (advanced): use thermal wave model + inverse problem algorithms (Fourier deconvolution, least-squares fitting) to extract depth-resolved spectra. Requires expertise, software (MATLAB custom scripts, or specialized PAS software like WinPAS).\n5. Comparison to Other Techniques: Correlate PAS spectrum with XRF (elemental composition), Raman (molecular structure), FTIR (if both available). PAS absorption spectrum should match material ID from other techniques (e.g., PAS shows vermilion absorption peak, XRF shows Hg, Raman shows HgS 254 cm⁻¹ → consistent).'}, 'artifacts_troubleshooting': '**Common Artifacts:**\n- Acoustic noise spikes (external vibration, building HVAC, people walking): narrow peaks at random wavelengths, vary between scans. Mitigation: acoustic isolation (foam around PA cell), measure in quiet hours (night), or average multiple scans (noise random, averages out).\n- Thermal drift baseline (sample or cell heating over time → signal drift): sloping baseline, baseline shifts during scan. Cause: excessive light intensity, poor thermal contact, ambient temperature change. Mitigation: reduce intensity, ensure good sample-gas thermal coupling (He atmosphere, intimate contact), stabilize room temp.\n- Moisture bands (NIR 1400, 1900 nm broad peaks from H₂O vapor in cell): incompletely purged cell. Mitigation: longer He purge (10-15 min), higher flow rate, or measure in dry region only (400-1300 nm).\n- Saturation (very strong absorbers → signal plateau, loss of linearity): PA signal saturates if absorption too high (all light absorbed in <μ_th, no depth variation). Mitigation: dilute sample (mix with non-absorbing powder like BaSO₄), use thinner sample, or increase frequency (shallower probe → less total absorption).\n- Wavelength shift vs. reflectance spectrum (PAS peaks may shift 5-10 nm from literature reflectance spectra): PAS measures absorption directly; reflectance affected by scattering, Kubelka-Munk transformation approximates absorption. Small shifts normal, but large (>20 nm) indicates calibration error or wrong material.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- No signal or very weak signal\n- Signal too strong (saturates lock-in or ADC)\n- Noisy spectrum (low SNR, erratic signal)\n- Spectrum changes between scans (irreproducible)\n- Depth profiling shows unexpected trends (e.g., surface more absorbing than bulk, but expect opposite)', 'multimodal_pairings': '**Complementary Techniques:**\n\n- xrf: XRF elemental, PAS molecular absorption. XRF identifies elements (Pb, Hg, Fe) → suggests pigments. PAS confirms via absorption spectrum (lead white vs minium both Pb, but different spectra). Depth: XRF ~10-100 μm fixed, PAS tunable 1-1000 μm.\n\n- raman-spectroscopy: Raman molecular structure (vibrational), PAS electronic/vibrational (UV-Vis-NIR). Complementary: Raman inorganics excellent, organics often fluoresce. PAS works on fluorescent materials (Raman fails). Depth: Raman surface ~μm, PAS tunable.\n\n- ftir-spectroscopy: FTIR fundamental vibrations (MIR), PAS overtones/combinations (NIR). FTIR-PAS (MIR) = FTIR without sample prep (powders, rough surfaces). PAS-NIR = overtones (weaker but bulk-sensitive, depth profiling). Use together: MIR for strong binder peaks, NIR for depth.\n\n- uv-vis-spectroscopy: Reflectance UV-Vis vs PAS UV-Vis: both probe electronic transitions. Reflectance affected by scattering (Kubelka-Munk approximation, indirect absorption). PAS direct absorption (scattering-insensitive). PAS superior for powders, dark/opaque materials. Reflectance easier (no special cell).\n\n\n**Standard Combinations:**\n\n- PAS + XRF (Molecular + Elemental Depth Profiling): XRF fast spatial survey (seconds per point, map large areas). PAS slower (minutes per location) but depth-tunable, molecular ID. XRF guides PAS sampling (where to measure). PAS resolves XRF ambiguities (multiple Pb pigments, PAS spectra distinguish).', 'strengths_limitations': {'strengths': ['See technique documentation'], 'limitations': ['See technique documentation']}, 'references': [{'citation': 'See technique documentation', 'doi': ''}], 'lab_checklist': ['Reference spectrum smooth (no spikes, sudden jumps; if noisy, lamp unstable or acoustic interference)', 'Baseline approximately flat after normalization (if sloped, check reference quality, thermal artifacts)', 'Reproducibility: remeasure same sample, spectra match ±5-10%', 'Depth dependence logical: low frequency (bulk) includes all features; high frequency (surface) shows only surface-layer features; surface-only peaks should be absent or reduced in bulk spectrum'], 'keywords': []}
