Pulsed laser light (ns-scale, typically NIR 700-1200 nm) illuminates the sample; absorbed photons generate localized transient heating (mK rise); thermoelastic expansion launches broadband ultrasonic waves (MHz frequencies) that propagate to the surface where an array of ultrasound transducers detects them. Time-of-flight of acoustic signals encodes depth; computational reconstruction algorithms (filtered back-projection, time-reversal, model-based) convert acoustic waveforms into 3D maps of optical absorption coefficient. PAT achieves optical contrast (molecular specificity: hemoglobin, melanin, lipids via spectral unmixing) with ultrasound resolution (100 μm - 1 mm) and penetration depth (mm to cm, exceeding pure optical imaging limited by scattering), and is emerging as a powerful tool for non-invasive subsurface imaging of cultural heritage objects.', 'abstract': 'Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), also called optoacoustic tomography (OAT), is a hybrid imaging technique combining optical excitation with ultrasonic detection to generate 3D images of optical absorption contrast within turbid media.

A short laser pulse (typically 5–10 ns) is delivered to a turbid medium. Absorbed photons raise the local temperature by ΔT in the μK–mK range. Under stress confinement (pulse duration much shorter than the acoustic transit time across the absorber), this rapid heating causes thermoelastic expansion and launches a broadband ultrasonic pressure wave. The initial pressure rise p_0 is proportional to the product of the local absorption coefficient μ_a, the optical fluence Φ, and the Grüneisen parameter Γ (which encodes the medium’s thermoelastic properties). These waves propagate outward at the sound speed c_s with minimal scattering compared to photons. An array of ultrasound detectors records the time-resolved pressure p(r⃗_d, t) at many positions. Reconstruction algorithms (e.g. filtered back-projection, time-reversal, iterative model-based inversion) solve the inverse problem p(r⃗_d, t) → p_0(r⃗) → μ_a(r⃗), yielding a 3D map of optical absorption.', 'instruments_components': "**Source:**\n{'type': 'Nanosecond pulsed laser, commonly Nd:YAG (1064 nm fundamental, 532 nm second harmonic) with optical parametric oscillator (OPO) for 700–1200 nm tuning, or Ti:sapphire and high-power diode/diode-pumped lasers for compact systems.', 'specifications': 'Pulse duration: 5–10 ns (ensuring stress confinement for efficient photoacoustic generation). Repetition rate: typically 10–50 Hz for Q-switched solid-state lasers, up to kHz for newer diode-based PAT systems.

Pulse energy: ~10–100 mJ at the laser output, often 1–20 mJ delivered to the object after beam delivery optics. Fluence at the sample is kept below heritage-safe limits (typically 5–20 mJ/cm², well below ANSI Z136.1 MPE where possible).', 'energyRange': 'Photon energies ~1.0–1.8 eV for 1200–700 nm; some systems allow extension to visible or short-wave IR via OPOs.', 'powerRange': 'Peak powers in the MW range during nanosecond pulses, but low average power (≤ a few watts) due to low duty cycle.'}\n\n**Detector:**\nUltrasound transducer arrays: (1) linear arrays (e.g., 128–256 elements, 5–10 MHz center frequency) for 2D slice imaging with mechanical translation; (2) curvilinear or hemispherical arrays with hundreds to thousands of elements for true 3D PAT; (3) single focused transducers scanned mechanically for lower-cost systems.\n\n**Optical System Components:**\n- Pulsed laser (Nd:YAG with OPO or Ti:sapphire / diode-based source)\n- Beam delivery optics or fiber bundles to homogenize and deliver a broad illumination spot (5–50 mm diameter) to the sample surface\n- Ultrasound transducer array (linear, arc, or hemispherical) mounted in a water tank or behind an acoustic coupling membrane\n- Coupling medium (degassed water or ultrasound gel) to provide efficient acoustic transmission between object and transducers\n- High-speed multi-channel data acquisition system (tens to hundreds of channels at 20–100 MHz sampling rates)\n- Motion stages for scanning the transducer or sample (in linear-array or single-element systems)\n- Control and reconstruction workstation (often with GPU acceleration for time-reversal and iterative algorithms)\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Pulsed laser with appropriate wavelength range, pulse duration, and energy (dominant cost and safety driver)\n- Ultrasound transducer array with sufficient element count, bandwidth, and sensitivity\n- High-speed, multi-channel DAQ with stable, low-jitter triggering\n- Acoustic coupling arrangement (water bath or gel/membrane) that is compatible with heritage materials\n- Robust and well-validated reconstruction software (FBP, time-reversal, or model-based) with appropriate sound-speed modeling\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\nA representative heritage PAT setup might use a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser pumping an OPO tuned to 800–900 nm (10 ns pulses, 10–20 Hz, 50–80 mJ per pulse), a 128-element linear ultrasound array with 5 MHz center frequency and ~70% fractional bandwidth, a water-coupling tank or gel-membrane interface above the painting or object, and a motorized XY stage to scan the array over a 50×50 mm region in 0.5–1 mm steps. Data are acquired with a 128-channel 40–60 MHz DAQ (e.g., Verasonics Vantage) and reconstructed using the k-Wave MATLAB toolbox running on a GPU-enabled workstation. A typical 50×50×5 mm³ volume with ~100–200 μm axial resolution and ~300–500 μm lateral sampling can be acquired in tens of minutes to a few hours, depending on averaging.", 'resolution_detection': "**Spatial Resolution:**\n{'lateral': 'Typically 100 μm to 1 mm, determined primarily by the acoustic wavelength and aperture. Higher ultrasound frequency (e.g., 10–20 MHz) yields finer lateral resolution (~100 μm) but reduces penetration due to increased attenuation; lower frequencies (1–5 MHz) provide coarser resolution (0.5–1 mm) but allow deeper imaging.', 'depth': 'Axial (depth) resolution is set by the detector bandwidth and the temporal sampling of the acoustic waveforms. For broadband transducers with 5–10 MHz bandwidth, axial resolutions on the order of 50–200 μm are typical. In many systems the axial resolution exceeds the lateral resolution.', 'limitingFactors': ['Ultrasound center frequency and bandwidth (higher frequencies and broader bandwidth improve resolution but reduce penetration)', 'Transducer aperture and viewing angle (limited-view geometries reduce effective lateral resolution and introduce artifacts)', 'Sound speed inhomogeneity (spatial variations in c_s cause phase aberrations and depth distortions if not modeled)', 'Signal bandwidth truncation (bandpass filtering and detector response shape the effective PSF)', 'Sampling density (scan step size and angular coverage must satisfy Nyquist criteria for accurate reconstruction)']}\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nThe usable imaging depth in PAT is governed by both optical and acoustic propagation. Optical penetration determines how deeply sufficient fluence reaches to excite absorbers, while acoustic propagation and detection determine how far the generated waves can travel back to the detectors with acceptable SNR. In turbid heritage materials (paints, wood, textiles), NIR wavelengths (700–1000 nm) offer a compromise between absorption and scattering, giving optical penetration on the order of 1–10 mm. Ultrasound in soft, low-loss media can propagate over centimeters, so in most heritage cases the optical transport is the limiting factor. Practical PAT imaging of paintings and polychrome objects typically achieves 0.5–10 mm depth, with deeper imaging (up to ~20 mm) possible in relatively transparent media like some woods.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nFor typical heritage PAT systems, absorption coefficients on the order of μ_a ≈ 0.01–0.1 cm⁻¹ can be detected at shallow depths, while strongly absorbing pigments (μ_a ≈ 10–100 cm⁻¹) are easily visible several millimeters beneath the surface. This corresponds to pigment volume fractions down to ~0.1–1 wt% for strongly absorbing species, depending on fluence, bandwidth, and averaging.", 'sample_requirements': '**Destructiveness:** non-destructive (pulsed laser with mJ-scale energy and ns pulses; operated below damage thresholds for heritage materials)\n\n**Portability:** primarily benchtop; early cart-mounted and prototype portable systems (50–100 kg) emerging for in-situ use\n\n**Sample Size:** Intact objects such as paintings and polychrome panels up to tens of centimeters across can be imaged; field-of-view is typically 5–200 mm depending on array size and scan range. Thicknesses up to several centimeters are accessible in wood and low-attenuation media, though practical heritage work often focuses on the first 1–2 cm from the surface.\n\n**Mounting Procedure:**\nThe object is mounted securely on a support or positioning stage, usually with the region of interest oriented toward the transducer array. For water-immersion setups, the object (or a portion of it) is placed in a sealed holder or tank filled with degassed water; for moisture-sensitive works, a thin transparent membrane with ultrasound gel may be used to provide acoustic coupling while protecting the surface from direct contact with water. Vibrational stability is important during long scans to avoid blurring.', 'measurement_protocol': {'preparation': ['Mounting: The object is mounted securely on a support or positioning stage, usually with the region of interest oriented toward the transducer array.

Vibrational stability is important during long scans to avoid blurring.', 'Surface preparation: No invasive surface preparation is required. However, loosely bound dust and particulates should be gently removed to avoid spurious surface absorption and to prevent contamination of the coupling medium. Highly reflective or absorbing surface coatings (e.g., metallic foils, thick black overpaints) may need to be characterized in advance, as they can dominate the photoacoustic signal and obscure deeper features.'], 'data_collection': ['System setup, safety check, and calibration: Power up the laser, DAQ, and motion control systems. Perform laser warm-up (15–30 minutes) and verify output energy and beam quality at the working wavelength (e.g., 800 nm). Confirm that all laser safety interlocks and beam enclosures are functional, and ensure all personnel wear appropriate eye protection. Calibrate the ultrasound system using a simple phantom (e.g., a point absorber or pencil lead in agar) to verify timing, sound speed, and basic resolution. Adjust the assumed sound speed in the reconstruction software until the reconstructed depth of the phantom matches its known physical position.', 'Sample positioning and acoustic coupling: Position the object so that the region of interest is within the transducer field-of-view. For water immersion, fill the coupling tank with degassed water and carefully remove air bubbles from the object surface and transducer face. For gel/membrane coupling, apply a uniform layer of ultrasound gel to the membrane, gently press it against the object surface, and check for trapped air. Use test ultrasound pulses or low-energy photoacoustic shots to confirm that strong, consistent signals are detected across the array.', 'Pilot acquisition and parameter optimization: Acquire a small pilot dataset (e.g., a single B-scan or a small 2D grid) to check signal levels, SNR, and potential artifacts. Adjust laser fluence to remain within safe limits while achieving adequate SNR (typically ≥20:1 for key features). Optimize the choice of wavelength based on expected absorbers: for carbon-based underdrawing, ~750–850 nm is often effective; for metal-based pigments or binders, consider scanning several wavelengths to identify optimal contrast. Tune DAQ settings (gain, sampling rate, number of averages) to balance SNR and acquisition time.', '3D volume acquisition: Define the scan geometry and sampling grid (e.g., a 2D raster of transducer positions over the region of interest, or a set of angular views if using a rotating or arcuate array). For each position or view, fire the laser and record the full set of time-resolved RF signals from all transducer elements. Optionally average multiple laser shots per position to improve SNR, taking care to monitor cumulative fluence on the object. Document all acquisition parameters (laser energy, wavelength, repetition rate, transducer model, sampling rate, scan geometry, coupling method) in metadata.', 'Multi-wavelength (spectroscopic) PAT (optional): For spectroscopic PAT, repeat the 3D acquisition at several wavelengths chosen to sample the absorption spectra of expected chromophores (e.g., carbon black, vermilion, ultramarine, binders). For each wavelength, measure and record the delivered fluence to enable normalization. After reconstructing volumes at each wavelength, perform spectral unmixing to estimate the spatial distribution of individual chromophores using reference spectra or library data.', 'Reconstruction and quality assurance: Transfer the raw RF data to the reconstruction workstation and perform preprocessing (bandpass filtering, time-gain compensation, bad-channel removal, and optional averaging). Choose and apply an appropriate reconstruction algorithm: filtered back-projection for rapid preview and qualitative assessment; time-reversal or iterative model-based methods for higher-quality, artifact-reduced volumes. Inspect reconstructed slices and maximum-intensity projections to verify that known test objects or features appear at the expected locations and depths. Adjust reconstruction parameters (sound speed, grid spacing, regularization strength) as needed.', 'Visualization, interpretation, and integration with other modalities: Visualize the reconstructed volume using slice displays, maximum intensity projections, and 3D volume rendering. Identify subsurface features such as underdrawings, pentimenti, internal cracks, or pigment stratigraphy. Where possible, co-register PAT volumes with other imaging data (visible/IR reflectography, X-radiography, MA-XRF, OCT) using shared fiducial markers or anatomical/structural landmarks.

For routine work, start with filtered back-projection or k-space time-reversal; for challenging limited-view data, consider model-based iterative reconstruction with appropriate priors or regularization.\n2. Image enhancement and artifact assessment: Inspect reconstructed volumes with linear and logarithmic intensity scaling; apply mild spatial filtering (e.g., Gaussian smoothing) to reduce noise while preserving structural detail. Identify apparent artifacts (streaks, rings, boundary echoes) and compare with expected patterns from the acquisition geometry.\n3. Segmentation and feature extraction: Segment regions of high absorption (e.g., underdrawings, pigment-rich layers, cracks filled with absorbing material) using thresholding, region-growing, or machine-learning-based segmentation. Extract morphological descriptors (thickness, curvature, connectivity) relevant to heritage questions.\n4. Depth profiling and quantitative measurements: Select lines or small ROIs and compute depth profiles of μ_a(z) to measure the depths and thicknesses of layers or hidden features. When calibrated, convert μ_a values into approximate absorber concentrations using known absorption coefficients; otherwise, interpret values qualitatively as relative contrasts.\n5. Spectroscopic unmixing (if multi-wavelength data are available): At each voxel, assemble the vector of μ_a(λ) values across wavelengths and model it as a linear combination of reference spectra for candidate chromophores. Solve the resulting linear or constrained least-squares problem to estimate the concentration maps for each pigment or binder. Validate assignments by comparing with independent spectroscopic measurements (Raman, FTIR, GC–MS, PAS).\n6. Multi-modal registration and interpretation: Register PAT volumes to X-radiography, MA-XRF maps, OCT stacks, or high-resolution photographs. Use these combined datasets to interpret which features correspond to specific materials or interventions (e.g., original underdrawing versus later overpaint) and to construct coherent 3D models of the object’s stratigraphy and condition.'}, 'artifacts_troubleshooting': '**Common Artifacts:**\n- Restricted angular coverage (e.g., single linear array on one side of the object) or missing transducer elements lead to incomplete sampling of the acoustic wavefield.\n- High absorption in surface layers (varnish, dark overpaint) produces dominant superficial signals that can mask deeper features; multiple acoustic reflections at the coupling interface can create ghost structures.\n- Incorrect assumptions about the speed of sound (c_s) or ignoring inhomogeneities in c_s across different layers (e.g., paint vs wood).\n- Severe optical attenuation by dense or highly scattering surface layers, or strong ultrasound attenuation at high frequencies.\n- Mechanical drift or vibration of the object or transducer during long acquisitions.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- No observable photoacoustic signal\n- Signal present but extremely low SNR\n- Reconstructed volume dominated by artifacts', 'multimodal_pairings': '**Complementary Techniques:**\n\n- x-ray-radiography-film: X-ray radiography is highly sensitive to dense, high-Z pigments such as lead white and vermilion but is largely insensitive to carbon-based underdrawings or low-Z organic materials. PAT, in contrast, highlights optical absorption from both inorganic and organic species. Combining X-radiography and PAT enables discrimination between dense overpaints and underlying carbon-rich features.\n\n- ma-xrf: Macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) provides element-specific surface or near-surface maps (Pb, Hg, Fe, Cu, Zn). PAT adds depth-resolved absorption maps. Registering MA-XRF and PAT volumes enables linking elemental distributions to depth-resolved chromophore maps, improving identification of pigments and stratigraphy.\n\n- infrared-reflectography: Infrared reflectography is the established tool for underdrawing detection and is relatively fast and widely available. PAT is particularly valuable when IRR fails due to overlying opaque or highly scattering layers. A typical workflow is to use IRR for broad surveys and reserve PAT for targeted, problematic areas.\n\n- oct: Optical coherence tomography provides micrometer-scale resolution of the top 1–2 mm of transparent or semi-transparent layers (varnish, glazes, some grounds). PAT extends the depth range to several millimeters with coarser resolution. Combining OCT and PAT yields a multi-scale view of surface and subsurface structures.\n\n- photoacoustic-spectroscopy: Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) offers high-sensitivity 1D depth profiling and spectral discrimination of chromophores at a single location. PAT provides 2D/3D spatial context. Using PAS to determine optimal wavelengths and spectral signatures, and PAT to map their distribution, allows more robust interpretation.\n\n- raman-spectroscopy: Raman spectroscopy provides highly specific molecular identification at or near the surface but is limited in depth and can be hampered by fluorescence. PAT, which relies on absorption rather than Raman scattering, can probe deeper and is less affected by fluorescence. Raman and PAT together can link surface molecular identifications to deeper 3D distributions.\n\n\n**Standard Combinations:**\n\n- PAT + X-radiography + MA-XRF for stratigraphic analysis: No single technique provides complete information about composition and structure in complex heritage objects. X-radiography excels at detecting dense materials, MA-XRF reveals elemental composition near the surface, and PAT adds volumetric absorption contrast for organics and inorganics. Their combination yields a powerful, non-destructive analysis of stratigraphy and can reduce the need for invasive sampling.', 'strengths_limitations': {'strengths': ['See technique documentation'], 'limitations': ['See technique documentation']}, 'references': [{'citation': 'See technique documentation', 'doi': ''}], 'lab_checklist': ['Verification that raw RF signals have adequate SNR and no systematic saturation or clipping', 'Depth measurements on phantoms agree with known geometries within the expected error (e.g., ±5–10%)', 'Reconstructed resolution (axial and lateral) is consistent with transducer specifications and design calculations', 'No significant motion artifacts or misalignment across the scanned volume', 'Reconstruction artifacts (streaks, rings, depth distortions) are understood and acceptable for the intended interpretation'], 'keywords': []}
