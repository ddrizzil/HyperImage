The technique reveals hidden compositions, artist alterations (pentimenti), and pigment layering by detecting characteristic X-ray fluorescence from elements in paint layers, allowing researchers to "see" beneath the surface without sampling. MA-XRF has become one of the most important tools in technical art history since the 2000s.', 'abstract': 'MA-XRF is a non-destructive elemental imaging technique that scans an X-ray beam across artwork surfaces to create spatial distribution maps of elements like lead, mercury, iron, copper, and calcium. The technique reveals hidden compositions, artist alterations (pentimenti), and pigment layering by detecting characteristic X-ray fluorescence from elements in paint layers, allowing researchers to "see" beneath the surface without sampling. MA-XRF has become one of the most important tools in technical art history since the 2000s.', 'physics_principle': 'When X-rays with sufficient energy strike atoms in a material, they can eject inner-shell electrons (typically K or L shell). This creates an unstable electronic configuration. An electron from a higher shell fills the vacancy, releasing energy as a characteristic X-ray photon with energy specific to the element and transition type. By detecting these fluorescent X-rays and mapping their intensity across a surface, MA-XRF creates elemental distribution images.\n\nThe technique is based on three fundamental processes:\n\n1. **Photoelectric absorption**: Incident X-rays eject inner-shell electrons\n\n2. **Atomic relaxation**: Outer-shell electrons fill vacancies\n\n3. **Fluorescent emission**: Characteristic X-rays are emitted\n\nThe depth of analysis depends on X-ray energy and material composition, typically sampling 10-200 μm in paint layers.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nX-ray tube (most common), or synchrotron radiation (research applications). X-ray tube specifications: Anode materials: Rhodium (Rh), Tungsten (W), Molybdenum (Mo), Silver (Ag). Operating voltage: 20-50 kV typical (adjustable). Current: 0.1-1.0 mA. Spot size: 50 μm - 2 mm diameter. Power: 4-50 W. Polychromatic vs. monochromatic: Standard MA-XRF uses polychromatic (white) X-rays; Filters (Al, Cu) used to shape spectrum and reduce low-energy component; Some systems offer monochromatic excitation for specific elements.\n\n**Detector:**\nPrimary detector type: Silicon Drift Detector (SDD). Active area: 7-80 mm². Energy resolution: 125-145 eV FWHM at Mn Kα (5.9 keV). Count rate: up to 10⁵-10⁶ cps (with pileup correction). Energy range: 1-40 keV (depending on model). Operating temperature: Peltier-cooled (-20 to -40°C). Alternative detectors: Si-PIN diodes (lower resolution, higher count rate), HPGe detectors (better resolution, requires liquid N₂ cooling), Multi-element SDD arrays (for faster acquisition).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Motorized XY scanning stage (Travel range: 50 × 50 cm to 200 × 200 cm, Step resolution: 10-50 μm, Positioning accuracy: ±50 μm)\n- Scanner head/gantry (Holds X-ray tube, detector, positioning optics, Weight: 5-30 kg, Adjustable height for varying painting sizes)\n- High-voltage power supply (Stable voltage regulation <0.01% drift, Current control, Safety interlocks)\n- Multi-channel analyzer (MCA) (Digital pulse processor, 2048-4096 channels, Real-time spectrum acquisition)\n- Positioning sensors (Laser distance sensors for surface topography, Maintain constant working distance, Accuracy: ±0.1-1 mm)\n- Video camera (Visible-light imaging for registration, Sample positioning verification)\n- Shielding and safety systems (Lead curtains or enclosure, X-ray interlock systems, Radiation monitors)\n- Computer and control software (Motor control, Spectrum acquisition, Real-time data processing)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Lab-based system:**\n- Vertical gantry with motorized XY stage (easel-mounted paintings)\n- Rh-anode X-ray tube (50 kV, 0.6 mA, 1 mm spot)\n- Polycapillary optics focusing to 200 μm\n- SDD detector (30 mm², 145 eV resolution)\n- Working distance: 1.5 cm\n- Al filter (250 μm)\n- Lead shielding enclosure\n- Footprint: 2 × 2 × 2.5 m (width × depth × height)\n\n**Portable/transportable configuration:**\n- Lightweight scanner head (<10 kg)\n- Mounted on tripod or adjustable frame\n- Can be positioned in front of wall-mounted paintings\n- Smaller scan areas (typically up to 50 × 50 cm per setup)\n- Battery-powered options available', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution (x-y): Typical 0.5-2 mm spot size; High-resolution systems: 50-200 μm. Limiting factors: X-ray beam collimation/focusing, source-sample-detector geometry, step size during scanning, count statistics. Depth Resolution (z): Poor depth discrimination in standard MA-XRF; Total sampling depth: 10-200 μm (energy and matrix dependent); Confocal XRF can achieve ~10-50 μm depth resolution.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nThe sampling depth is energy-dependent and material-dependent. For oil paint: Light elements (Ca, K) 20-50 μm; Medium Z (Fe, Cu) 50-100 μm; Heavy elements (Pb, Hg) 100-200 μm. Factors affecting penetration: Higher energy X-rays penetrate deeper; Lower atomic number elements have shallower information depth; Matrix composition (oil vs. tempera vs. watercolor); Paint thickness and layering.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nTypical detection limits: 10-100 ppm (parts per million) for medium-Z elements. Major elements (>1%): Quantifiable with standards. Minor elements (0.1-1%): Semi-quantitative. Trace elements (<0.1%): Detection possible but challenging. Dynamic range: 10⁴-10⁶ depending on element and acquisition time. Best sensitivity: Elements with Z = 20-30 (Ca to Zn). Poor sensitivity: Very light elements (Z < 14, Na) and very heavy (Z > 83).', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** transportable\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['No sample preparation required - completely non-destructive, in-situ technique', 'No surface preparation typically required', 'Painting can be scanned in frame (frame may cast shadows)', 'Dust or loose particulates should be gently removed (conservator)', 'Glass/acrylic glazing must be removed (causes scatter and absorption)', 'Surface should be accessible and relatively flat', 'Easel-mounted paintings: ideal for vertical scanners', 'Horizontal surface scanning: for large or fragile objects', 'Irregular surfaces: requires distance monitoring and mapping', 'Pre-scan documentation: High-resolution visible-light photography for registration, Condition documentation, Surface topography mapping if available, UV and IR imaging recommended (for comparison/registration)']", 'measurement_protocol': {'preparation': ["['No sample preparation required - completely non-destructive, in-situ technique', 'No surface preparation typically required', 'Painting can be scanned in frame (frame may cast shadows)', 'Dust or loose particulates should be gently removed (conservator)', 'Glass/acrylic glazing must be removed (causes scatter and absorption)', 'Surface should be accessible and relatively flat', 'Easel-mounted paintings: ideal for vertical scanners', 'Horizontal surface scanning: for large or fragile objects', 'Irregular surfaces: requires distance monitoring and mapping', 'Pre-scan documentation: High-resolution visible-light photography for registration, Condition documentation, Surface topography mapping if available, UV and IR imaging recommended (for comparison/registration)']"], 'data_collection': ['**STEP 1: Setup and Safety (15-30 minutes)**\n- Position painting in scanner frame or mount portable scanner\n- Ensure radiation shielding is in place\n- Verify interlock systems functional\n- Post radiation warning signs\n- Clear area of unnecessary personnel\n\n**STEP 2: Alignment and Registration (15-30 minutes)**\n- Acquire visible-light reference photograph\n- Position scanner head at safe working distance\n- Use laser distance sensor to map surface topography\n- Define coordinate system and scan boundaries\n- Mark fiducial points for registration\n- Critical parameters: Working distance accuracy ±0.5 mm\n\n**STEP 3: System Calibration (10-20 minutes)**\n- Measure reference spectrum on calibration standard (brass, stainless steel)\n- Verify characteristic peak positions (Kα, Kβ)\n- Check energy calibration across full spectrum\n- Verify detector resolution and peak shape\n- Adjust tube voltage/current if needed\n- Typical parameters: Calibration standard: NIST 1577c bovine liver or copper;
