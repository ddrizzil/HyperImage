When energetic ions collide with atoms, inner-shell electrons are ejected, and subsequent electronic transitions produce element-specific X-ray fluorescence. PIXE offers superior sensitivity (ppm-ppb detection limits) compared to electron-based techniques (SEM-EDX) due to lower background bremsstrahlung radiation, can analyze elements from Na to U simultaneously, and is essentially non-destructive for most heritage materials. In cultural heritage, PIXE enables quantitative pigment identification, provenance studies via trace element fingerprinting, and rapid multi-element mapping of paintings, ceramics, metals, and glass.', 'abstract': 'Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is a highly sensitive elemental analysis technique that uses MeV-energy ion beams (typically protons or alpha particles) to excite characteristic X-rays from elements in a sample.

The ion beam ionizes inner-shell electrons (K, L, M shells) through inelastic collisions. When outer-shell electrons transition to fill these vacancies, characteristic X-rays are emitted with energies specific to each element (e.g., Fe Kα = 6.4 keV). Protons are preferred over electrons because: (1) Higher ionization cross-section for heavy elements, (2) Minimal bremsstrahlung background (protons ~2000× heavier than electrons don't decelerate radiatively), (3) Lower detection limits (ppm vs. 0.1% for SEM-EDX). Silicon drift detector (SDD) measures X-ray energies and intensities; quantification via comparison to standards or fundamental parameters.", 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nParticle accelerator (cyclotron, tandem accelerator, or Van de Graaff). Protons (H⁺): 1-4 MeV typical; alpha particles (He²⁺): 2-6 MeV alternative. High current stability (<1% fluctuation). Beam currents: 1-100 nA for microbeam, 1-100 pA for nanobeam. 1-4 MeV for protons (optimized for heritage materials). Beam power: 1-100 μW typical (low enough to avoid sample damage). Proton beam: monoenergetic (ΔE/E ~ 10⁻³); collimated (1-10 mrad divergence); pulsed or continuous.\n\n**Detector:**\nSilicon Drift Detector (SDD) - modern standard, Si(Li) detector - older systems, or Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Detects X-rays from 1-30 keV (Na Kα to Rb Kα; higher Z via L-lines). SDD: >95% for 5-10 keV; decreases at low energy (<2 keV, Be window absorption) and high energy (>20 keV, reduced interaction). Time resolution: Nanosecond time resolution possible (for pulsed beam PIXE).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Particle accelerator with stable beam current and energy\n- High-resolution X-ray detector (SDD with <130 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV)\n- Beam current integrator (accurate charge measurement for quantification)\n- Vacuum system (sample chamber typically 10⁻⁵-10⁻⁶ mbar) or external beam setup\n- Motorized sample stage (XYZ positioning, rotation for scanning PIXE)\n- Beam focusing system (magnetic quadrupoles for microbeam)\n- Absorber filters (to attenuate low-energy X-rays and reduce detector deadtime)\n- Data acquisition system (multichannel analyzer, real-time spectral display)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard PIXE setup:** 3 MeV proton beam from tandem accelerator or cyclotron. Beam current 10-50 nA. Sample in vacuum chamber (10⁻⁵ mbar) or external beam (atmospheric pressure). SDD detector (80 mm² area, 130 eV resolution) positioned 135° to beam direction, 10-20 mm from sample. Funny filter (absorber: 100-300 μm Al or Mylar) attenuates low-Z X-rays. Beam charge measured via Faraday cup. Acquisition time: 5-15 minutes for spectrum. Motorized stage allows 2D scanning for elemental maps (step size 10-100 μm).', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 1 μm - 1 mm (microbeam PIXE: 1-10 μm with focusing; broad beam: 0.1-1 mm). Depth Resolution: 10-50 μm (depth-integrated; not depth-resolved without special techniques). Limiting factors: Ion beam focusing capability (magnetic quadrupole lenses for microbeam), Ion scattering in material (beam broadens with depth), X-ray production volume (not a point source), Sample charging (insulators can defocus beam), Beam stability and positioning accuracy.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nPIXE is a bulk technique probing the ion range (penetration depth) in the material. For 2-3 MeV protons: ~20-40 μm in organic materials (paintings, paper), ~10-20 μm in ceramics/stone, ~5-15 μm in metals. X-rays generated throughout the ion path are detected (depth-integrated analysis). Lighter proton energies or external beam geometry enable near-surface analysis (<5 μm). Oil paint (organic matrix + pigments): 20-40 μm for 3 MeV protons, entire paint layer thickness typically sampled; provides bulk composition. Paper and parchment: 50-100 μm (often full thickness), low-Z organic material; protons penetrate completely through thin samples. Ceramics and pottery: 10-20 μm, probes glaze and upper body; depth-integrated composition. Glass: 15-30 μm, bulk analysis of upper surface layer. Metals (bronze, silver, gold): 5-15 μm, surface and near-surface composition; can detect enrichment/depletion. Stone/marble: 10-25 μm, near-surface analysis; suitable for weathering studies.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\n1-100 ppm (μg/g) for most elements Z > 11; sub-ppm for heavy elements (Z > 30) in light matrices. Dynamic range: 10⁵-10⁶ (major elements % to trace elements ppm in single analysis).
