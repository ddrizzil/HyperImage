CARS uses two laser beams (pump and Stokes) to coherently excite molecular vibrations, then probes with a third beam to generate anti-Stokes signal at a blue-shifted wavelength. Unlike spontaneous Raman, CARS is orders of magnitude faster, enables video-rate chemical imaging, and provides intrinsic 3D sectioning. In cultural heritage, CARS rapidly maps pigment distributions, identifies binding media, visualizes lipid and protein domains, and distinguishes original from restoration materials based on molecular signatures.', 'abstract': 'Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy is a label-free nonlinear optical technique that provides chemically specific contrast based on molecular vibrations.

In cultural heritage, CARS rapidly maps pigment distributions, identifies binding media, visualizes lipid and protein domains, and distinguishes original from restoration materials based on molecular signatures.', 'physics_principle': 'CARS is a four-wave mixing process involving three input beams: pump (ω_p), Stokes (ω_s), and probe (ω_pr, often same as pump). When the frequency difference (ω_p - ω_s) matches a molecular vibrational frequency Ω, the molecule resonantly oscillates. The probe beam then scatters off this coherent vibrational oscillation, generating anti-Stokes signal at ω_as = ω_p - ω_s + ω_pr = 2ω_p - ω_s (blue-shifted from pump). CARS signal is coherent (directional, phase-matched), scales as the square of molecular density, and is 10^4-10^6× stronger than spontaneous Raman, enabling video-rate chemical imaging with sub-micron spatial resolution.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nTwo synchronized femtosecond or picosecond pulsed lasers (pump + Stokes). Typical: Ti:Sapphire (pump, 800 nm) + OPO (Stokes, tunable 900-1300 nm); synchronized via electronic control; 80 MHz repetition rate; 2-5 ps pulses (picosecond) or 100-200 fs (femtosecond). Pump: 700-900 nm; Stokes: 900-1300 nm; tunable difference frequency to access 500-4000 cm⁻¹ vibrational range. Pump: 10-50 mW at sample; Stokes: 5-30 mW; total <80 mW to avoid damage. Both beams Gaussian TEM₀₀; linearly polarized (typically parallel); spectrally narrow (<10 cm⁻¹) or broadband (100-3000 cm⁻¹ for multiplex CARS).\n\n**Detector:**\nPhotomultiplier tube (PMT) for narrowband CARS, Spectrometer + CCD for multiplex (broadband) CARS, or Photodiode for high-speed imaging. Anti-Stokes typically 600-850 nm (visible-NIR) depending on pump/Stokes wavelengths. Efficiency: PMT 20-40% QE in visible; CCD 50-90% QE; photodiode fast response (<1 ns). Time resolution: Video-rate capable (10-30 fps for single-frequency CARS); spectrometer: 10-100 ms per spectrum.\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Two synchronized picosecond or femtosecond lasers (Ti:Sapphire + OPO typical)\n- Electronic synchronization module (jitter <50 fs for picosecond, <10 fs for femtosecond)\n- Motorized delay stage (femtosecond precision for pulse overlap)\n- High-NA objective (60-100×, NA 1.0-1.4) with good NIR transmission\n- Dichroic beamsplitters: separate pump/Stokes from anti-Stokes\n- Narrowband filters centered at anti-Stokes wavelength (e.g., 650 ± 10 nm)\n- Forward detector (optional but recommended for thick samples)\n- Spectrometer + CCD (for multiplex CARS hyperspectral imaging)\n- Pulse picker or AOM for power modulation\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard CARS microscope:** Ti:Sapphire laser (pump, 800 nm, 5 ps, 80 MHz) synchronized with OPO (Stokes, tunable 1000-1100 nm for 2800-3000 cm⁻¹ C-H region). Electronic locking ensures <50 fs timing jitter. Beams combined collinearly, expanded to fill objective aperture. 60×/1.2 NA water objective focuses both beams to ~0.5 μm spot. CARS signal (~650 nm for 2845 cm⁻¹ C-H) collected epi-detected via PMT or forward via condenser + PMT. Scan at 512×512 pixels, 1-10 Hz frame rate. For multiplex CARS: broadband Stokes (~100 cm⁻¹ bandwidth), collect via spectrometer.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 0.3-0.5 μm (diffraction-limited; similar to other nonlinear techniques). Depth Resolution: 1-3 μm axial resolution (intrinsic 3D sectioning from nonlinear excitation). Limiting factors: Numerical aperture of objective (higher NA = better resolution), Excitation wavelengths (typically NIR: 700-900 nm pump, 900-1100 nm Stokes), Pulse temporal overlap (pump and Stokes must overlap in time at focus), Non-resonant background reduces contrast (limits effective resolution), Scattering in sample.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nCARS penetration depth depends on NIR excitation light scattering and absorption at the anti-Stokes wavelength. Typical imaging depth: 50-200 μm in biological tissues and heritage materials. Forward-detected CARS (F-CARS) probes thicker samples than epi-detected CARS. Depth limited by scattering of pump/Stokes beams and absorption of anti-Stokes signal. Paint cross-sections (resin-embedded): 50-150 μm typical, excellent chemical contrast through multiple layers. Oil paint binding media: 30-100 μm, strong C-H signal from lipids; can image through pigment layers. Varnish layers: 100-300 μm possible if transparent, resin composition identifiable via C-H and aromatic signatures. Protein-based materials (collagen, egg): 50-150 μm, amide I (C=O) and protein C-H signals. Pigment particles: Surface to ~100 μm, varies by pigment; some have strong Raman, others weak.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\n~10 mM concentration for typical organic molecules; single lipid bilayer detectable (~5 nm thickness). Dynamic range: 10³-10⁴ (concentration range over which signal is linear).
