It has been used since the 1920s and remains a foundational examination technique despite the rise of digital methods.', 'physics_principle': "X-ray radiography is based on differential attenuation of X-rays as they traverse materials of varying density and atomic composition. When a polychromatic X-ray beam passes through an object, photons are absorbed or scattered depending on the material's mass attenuation coefficient, which increases with atomic number (Z) and decreases with photon energy. The transmitted X-rays expose photographic film or phosphor plates, with darker areas indicating greater X-ray transmission (less dense or lower-Z materials) and lighter areas indicating greater absorption (denser or higher-Z materials). The resulting radiograph is essentially a 2D shadow map of the object's internal density distribution.", 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nX-ray tube (industrial or medical diagnostic). Tungsten or molybdenum anode; water or oil-cooled housing. Energy range: 20-150 kV (typical: 40-100 kV for paintings, 80-150 kV for dense objects). Power range: 50-500 W continuous; up to 3 kW for large installations. Beam characteristics: Polychromatic (bremsstrahlung continuum + characteristic lines); cone-beam geometry; focal spot 0.3-3 mm.\n\n**Detector:**\nRadiographic film (historically), Phosphor imaging plates, or Indirect digital detectors. Sensitive to 10-150 keV X-rays. Efficiency: Film 1-5% quantum efficiency; Phosphor plates 20-40%; Digital up to 70%. Time resolution: Not applicable (static imaging).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- X-ray tube with stable high-voltage power supply\n- Collimator and beam-shaping apertures\n- Cassette holder or film processor\n- Object support structure (easel or horizontal table)\n- Lead-lined room or portable shielding enclosure\n- Exposure timer and control system\n- Film processor (darkroom) or phosphor plate reader\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard setup:** X-ray tube mounted 1-2 m from object; film cassette placed in contact with or immediately behind object; tube oriented perpendicular to object surface. For panel paintings, tube positioned horizontally with painting vertical on easel. Source-to-film distance (SFD) typically 100-200 cm. Larger SFD reduces magnification and geometric unsharpness but requires longer exposure.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 0.1-1 mm (film-based); limited by X-ray focal spot size, film grain, object-to-film distance. Depth Resolution: No depth resolution - 2D projection integrates entire object thickness. Limiting factors: X-ray tube focal spot size (typical: 0.3-3 mm), Geometric unsharpness (penumbra effect from finite source size), Film grain size (25-200 μm depending on film type), Object-to-film distance (closer = sharper), Motion blur if object moves during exposure.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nX-ray radiography is a transmission technique that samples the entire thickness of the object. Penetration depth depends on X-ray energy and material composition. Diagnostic X-rays (40-100 kV) penetrate several centimeters of organic materials but are strongly attenuated by metals and dense pigments. Canvas (cellulose): Full thickness (typically 0.5-2 mm), high transmission. Wood panels (oak, poplar): Up to 5 cm at 80-100 kV, good penetration. Lead white paint layer: High attenuation even at ~50 μm thickness, appears bright white. Oil paint (mixed pigments): Full paint thickness imaged, contrast depends on pigment atomic number. Copper alloy (bronze): ~0.5-2 cm depending on kV, high attenuation. Stone (marble): 2-10 cm depending on kV and density, moderate attenuation.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nCan detect ~2% density difference or thickness change of 0.1-1 mm depending on material. Dynamic range: Film ~10²-10³; Digital plates ~10⁴. Signal-to-noise: Depends on exposure time, film speed, and processing quality; typical SNR: 20-100:1.', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** transportable\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['No sampling required - completely non-destructive', 'Object positioned on easel (paintings) or table (sculptures, artifacts).

Position X-ray tube perpendicular to object surface at desired source-to-object distance (typically 1.5-2 m). Ensure object is stable and will not move.\n\n**STEP 3: Film or Detector Placement (5 minutes)**\n- Place film cassette or imaging plate in contact with rear surface of object (or as close as possible). For thick objects, use film holder at fixed distance. Ensure detector covers region of interest. Mark orientation for later reference.\n\n**STEP 4: Exposure Parameter Selection (5 minutes)**\n- Select tube voltage (kV) and current (mA) based on object thickness and material.

Calculate exposure time using technique charts or test exposures.\n\n**STEP 5: Test Exposure (Optional but Recommended, 10-15 minutes)**\n- Make short test exposure (50% of estimated time) on small film piece or digital preview. Process and evaluate density. Adjust kV or mAs if under- or over-exposed.\n\n**STEP 6: Full Exposure (0.5-5 minutes)**\n- Clear room of all personnel.
