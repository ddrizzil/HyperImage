Unlike SHG which requires non-centrosymmetric structures, THG occurs at refractive index discontinuities and is sensitive to layer boundaries, lipid interfaces, and material inhomogeneities. In cultural heritage, THG reveals varnish-paint interfaces, layer structures in cross-sections, oil droplets in binding media, and interfaces between different pigment layers, all without staining or sample damage.', 'abstract': 'Third harmonic generation microscopy is a label-free nonlinear optical technique that generates contrast from optical interfaces and heterogeneities by converting three incident photons of frequency ω into a single photon at frequency 3ω.

In cultural heritage, THG reveals varnish-paint interfaces, layer structures in cross-sections, oil droplets in binding media, and interfaces between different pigment layers, all without staining or sample damage.', 'physics_principle': "THG is a third-order nonlinear optical process where three photons of the same frequency (ω) interact simultaneously with a material to generate a single photon at exactly three times the frequency (3ω, one-third the wavelength). Unlike SHG, THG does not require broken inversion symmetry - it occurs in all materials but is strongest at interfaces where the third-order susceptibility χ⁽³⁾ or refractive index changes abruptly. THG is a parametric process (no energy absorbed), coherent (phase-dependent), and provides intrinsic 3D sectioning. The signal is generated primarily at optical interfaces, making THG an excellent 'interface detector' complementary to SHG's 'structure detector' role.", 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nMode-locked femtosecond pulsed laser (Ti:Sapphire, OPO, or fiber laser). 80-100 MHz repetition rate; 50-150 fs pulse duration; tunable 1000-1600 nm (longer λ than SHG). Excitation: 1200-1300 nm typical (THG at 400-433 nm, visible blue); NIR avoids UV generation issues. Average power at sample: 20-100 mW (higher than SHG due to I³ dependence; peak power: 20-200 kW). Gaussian TEM₀₀ mode; linearly polarized typically; <1 nm bandwidth.\n\n**Detector:**\nPhotomultiplier tube (PMT) with UV-blue sensitivity, Hybrid detector (GaAsP), or Silicon PMT for high QE. Sensitive to 350-550 nm (third harmonic is in UV-visible range). Efficiency: PMT 15-40% QE at THG wavelengths (400-450 nm); Hybrid 30-50% QE; Si-PMT 40-60% QE. Time resolution: Nanosecond for photon counting; gated detection to reduce background.\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Femtosecond laser with <150 fs pulses at sample (shorter than SHG)\n- High-NA objective lens (60-100×, NA 1.0-1.4); achromatic over NIR-visible range\n- Short-pass dichroic beamsplitter (reflects 1200+ nm NIR, transmits <500 nm THG)\n- Narrow bandpass filter centered at λ_exc/3 (e.g., 400-420 nm for 1200 nm excitation)\n- Dispersion compensation optics (prism pair or chirped mirrors)\n- Non-descanned detection path (PMT close to objective for max collection)\n- UV-compatible optics (lens coatings, filters) for <400 nm THG wavelengths\n- Environmental chamber (humidity control for hygroscopic samples)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard THG microscope:** Same platform as SHG - laser-scanning confocal microscope adapted for multiphoton. OPO laser (1200 nm, 100 fs, 80 MHz) or Ti:Sapphire at longer wavelength. Sample on motorized stage with Z-piezo. Epi-detection: PMT after objective, non-descanned. Forward detection: transmission PMT with high-NA condenser. Bandpass filter 390-430 nm for 1200 nm excitation (400 nm THG). Dispersion compensation critical - verify pulses <150 fs at sample focus.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 0.3-0.5 μm (diffraction-limited; similar to SHG, depends on NA and excitation wavelength). Depth Resolution: 0.8-2 μm axial resolution (intrinsic 3D sectioning from nonlinear I³ dependence). Limiting factors: Numerical aperture of objective (higher NA = better resolution), Excitation wavelength (typically 1200-1300 nm for THG to avoid UV damage at THG wavelength), Scattering in sample (reduces resolution at depth), Pulse width (femtosecond pulses required; THG needs shorter pulses than SHG), Signal-to-noise ratio (THG generally weaker than SHG).\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nTHG penetration depth is similar to SHG, limited by scattering of NIR excitation light and absorption at the UV/visible THG wavelength. Typical depth: 50-200 μm in biological tissues; potentially deeper in transparent materials. Forward-detected THG probes thicker samples. Epi-detected THG limited to ~50-100 μm by THG photon absorption during return path. Varnish layers (transparent): 100-300 μm penetration possible, THG detects upper and lower interfaces; internal bubbles and inhomogeneities. Paint cross-sections: 50-200 μm typical, each layer interface produces THG; stack multiple layers visible. Oil paint binding media: 30-100 μm, THG from oil droplets and pigment-binder interfaces. Resin-embedded samples: 100-300 μm, excellent THG from original material-resin boundary. Pigment particles: Surface to ~100 μm, THG at particle edges where refractive index changes.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nSingle lipid droplet detectable (~0.5-1 μm diameter); refractive index change Δn ≥ 0.01 at interfaces. Dynamic range: 10³-10⁴ (limited by detector and laser power range). Signal-to-noise: SNR 10-50:1 typical for interfaces in heritage materials; lower than SHG due to weaker signal.', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** laboratory-only\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Sampling required: 50 μm - 1 mm thickness; micro-samples or thin cross-sections ideal', 'Mount sample on glass coverslip (No. 1.5, 170 μm) or slide.
