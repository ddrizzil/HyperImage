A focused laser beam (typically 532 nm or 785 nm) excites molecular vibrations in a diffraction-limited volume (~1-10 μm³), and inelastically scattered light is analyzed to produce a characteristic Raman spectrum (100-3500 cm⁻¹). The technique enables non-destructive chemical identification of microscopic features—individual pigment grains, thin paint layers, corrosion products, polymer phases—that are invisible or ambiguous in conventional Raman or other bulk techniques. Confocal configuration (pinhole aperture) provides depth discrimination (2-10 μm axial resolution), enabling three-dimensional chemical mapping through transparent layers without cross-sectioning. Heritage applications focus on pigment identification in paint cross-sections, micro-samples from valuable objects, and in-situ analysis where spatial heterogeneity demands microscopic examination.', 'abstract': 'Micro-Raman spectroscopy combines Raman spectroscopy with optical microscopy to achieve molecular identification at sub-micrometer spatial resolution (0.5-2 μm spot size).

Lateral resolution d ≈ 0.61λ/NA; axial resolution Δz ≈ 2λ/(NA)² for confocal. Smaller probe volume (~1 μm³ vs. 100-1000 μm³ macro) enables single-grain analysis but requires adequate signal (longer integration or higher power to compensate for fewer molecules in probe volume).', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nSame lasers as macro-Raman: 532 nm DPSS (high efficiency, fluorescence risk), 785 nm diode (fluorescence mitigation). Power at sample: 0.1-10 mW typical (lower than macro due to smaller spot → higher power density → damage risk). Power range: 0.1-5 mW for organics/sensitive pigments; 1-50 mW for robust inorganics/minerals.\n\n**Detector:**\nBack-thinned CCD (-70°C), EMCCD, or InGaAs array (NIR). Spectral range: 100-4000 cm⁻¹ Raman shift. Efficiency: QE 90%+ peak (CCD 600-800 nm).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- High-NA objective (heart of system: determines resolution, working distance, collection efficiency)\n- Confocal pinhole (enables depth discrimination; without it, μ-Raman = diffraction-limited but not depth-resolved)\n- Precision stage (sub-μm positioning for accurate mapping, reproducible point locations)\n- Stable microscope platform (vibration → focal drift → signal loss; optical table or damping essential)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\nRenishaw inVia or Horiba LabRAM equipped with: 532 nm + 785 nm lasers; Leica/Olympus microscope with 5×, 20×, 50× LWD, 100× objectives; motorized XYZ stage; confocal pinhole 50-300 μm; 1800 l/mm grating (1-2 cm⁻¹ resolution); Peltier-cooled CCD.

Depth: 2-10 μm confocal (50-100 μm pinhole typical). Non-confocal 20-100 μm. Limiting factors: Diffraction (λ/NA limit), Sample scattering (rough surfaces blur spot), Aberrations (focus through layers with refractive index mismatch), Working distance (high NA → short WD, access limitations).\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nConfocal: 2-10 μm depending on NA and pinhole size. Non-confocal: 20-100 μm (depth of field). Penetration depends on sample transparency: opaque materials (surface only), transparent (probe through 100+ μm depth if focused internally).\n\n**Detection Limits:**\n10⁻¹⁵-10⁻¹⁸ mol detectable (femtomole-attomole in probe volume). ~0.1-1 wt% for mixtures.

Select objective: 50× LWD (NA 0.5, WD 8 mm) for general use; 100× (NA 0.9, WD 0.3 mm) for maximum resolution on flat samples. Verify laser alignment (center spot in field of view). Duration: 15 minutes. Critical parameters: Silicon peak at 520.7 ± 0.5 cm⁻¹, Laser spot centered, Objective selected for application.\n\n**Step 2: Sample Positioning and Focus**\nLocate feature of interest via optical microscopy (video camera, white light). Position laser spot on target (XY joystick, sub-μm precision). Focus critically: Z-scan ±10 μm, select Z giving maximum Raman intensity. For confocal: pinhole rejection out-of-focus → signal very sensitive to focus. Duration: 5-15 minutes per feature. Critical parameters: Laser spot on target feature, Focus optimized (maximum signal), Stage stable.\n\n**Step 3: Acquisition**\nTest spectrum (1-5 s, low power 0.5-2 mW). Optimize: if fluorescence, try 785 nm or photobleach; if weak, increase power (monitor damage) or integration time (10-60 s). Acquire final spectrum (3-5 accumulations). For maps: define area, step size (0.5-5 μm), automate (1-10 hours for 50×50 μm² at 1 μm steps). Duration: 1-60 minutes per point/map. Critical parameters: SNR >10:1, No sample damage, Appropriate parameters.\n\n**Step 4: Depth Profiling (Optional)**\nFix XY, acquire spectra at multiple Z (step 1-5 μm through depth). Confocal pinhole rejects signal from out-of-focus planes → Z-resolved chemical profile (e.g., layer stack in cross-section). Duration: 30 minutes - 2 hours. Critical parameters: Confocal pinhole set, Step size <depth resolution, Refractive index correction applied.'], 'calibration': ['**Standards:** Silicon wafer (520.7 cm⁻¹, daily), Polystyrene (multi-peak, weekly check). **Frequency:** Daily wavelength calibration essential (thermal drift affects μm-scale positioning). **Procedure:** Focus on Si wafer, acquire spectrum, verify 520.7 ± 0.5 cm⁻¹. Check laser spot size via knife-edge scan or fluorescent slide (ensure ~1 μm FWHM).']}, 'data_outputs': '**Raw Data Format:**\nSame as macro-Raman (.spc, .wxd, .txt).

Methods: Maximum intensity = 1.0, Area normalization, Internal standard.\n- Same preprocessing as macro-Raman (see raman-spectroscopy for details)', 'analysis_workflow': '**Step 1: Identify peaks, assign to vibrations**\nLoad spectrum, identify all significant peaks (peak-finding algorithm or manual). Record peak positions (wavenumbers). Assign peaks to vibrational modes using reference data (RRUFF, pigment libraries, literature). Match peak positions (±5 cm⁻¹ tolerance). Identify compound if multiple peaks match single reference.\n\n**Step 2: For maps: extract chemical images**\nLoad hyperspectral map dataset (3D: X × Y × wavenumber). Select peak of interest (characteristic peak for compound). Generate chemical map: integrate intensity in peak region (±5-10 cm⁻¹ window) at each XY pixel → create 2D image (intensity map, shows spatial distribution). Display as false-color (hot colors = high concentration, cool = low). Repeat for multiple compounds: create separate maps, overlay as RGB composite.\n\n**Step 3: Overlay on optical micrograph**\nCorrelate chemistry with morphology: load optical micrograph (white-light image of same area). Register Raman chemical map to micrograph (fiducial markers, feature-based alignment). Overlay false-color chemical map on grayscale micrograph (transparency blend) → see where pigments/compounds located relative to visible features (grains, layers, cracks).\n\n**Step 4: Quantify mixtures**\nFor mixtures: identify peak groups belonging to each component. Estimate compositions: integrate areas of peaks for each component, calculate relative % (semi-quantitative: peak area ∝ concentration × Raman cross-section). For complex mixtures: use multivariate analysis (PCA, MCR) to extract pure-component spectra.
