high_resolution_visible_photography_data = {'one_line_summary': "High-resolution visible photography is the systematic capture of detailed digital images using visible light (400-700 nm) to create comprehensive visual documentation of cultural heritage objects, monuments, and sites. Unlike casual photography, heritage documentation employs rigorous technical standards including controlled illumination (color temperature 5000-6500K, diffuse or raking light), color-calibrated workflows (ICC profiles, color targets), high-resolution sensors (20-100+ megapixels), precise exposure control, and standardized viewing geometries to ensure accurate, reproducible records of an object's current appearance. High-resolution photography serves as the foundation for condition assessment, conservation treatment documentation, publication, digital archives, and public access, capturing surface detail (cracks, losses, texture), color (pigments, patina, degradation), and overall condition with spatial resolution from 50 μm/pixel (close-up macro) to 5 mm/pixel (architecture). Advanced techniques include focus stacking (extended depth of field), HDR imaging (expanded dynamic range), gigapixel panoramas (extremely high resolution across large objects), and photogrammetry integration (3D reconstruction from photographs). In cultural heritage, visible photography is universally applied as the primary non-contact documentation method, providing accessible visual records that complement analytical techniques while serving conservation, research, education, and public engagement needs.", 'abstract': "High-resolution visible photography is the systematic capture of detailed digital images using visible light (400-700 nm) to create comprehensive visual documentation of cultural heritage objects, monuments, and sites.

In digital photography, the lens focuses light onto a sensor array (typically CMOS or CCD) where photons are converted to electrons via the photoelectric effect. Each pixel (photosite) accumulates charge proportional to incident light intensity over the exposure duration. Analog-to-digital conversion yields pixel values (typically 12-16 bit raw data, 8-bit per channel for JPEG). The image represents the object's spectral reflectance convolved with: (1) illumination spectrum (light source), (2) lens transmittance, (3) sensor spectral response (filtered by Bayer pattern color filters for RGB cameras), (4) camera processing (white balance, tone curve, color space conversion). High-resolution heritage photography optimizes each factor: calibrated illumination (known color temperature), high-quality optics (low distortion, high MTF), large sensor (high pixel count, low noise), raw capture (preserve maximum information), color management (ICC profiles for accurate reproduction).", 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nIllumination: (1) Natural daylight (indirect, diffuse), (2) Continuous artificial (LED panels, tungsten halogen), (3) Flash/strobe (electronic flash units). Color temperature: 5000-6500K (daylight equivalent) for color-accurate documentation; 2700-3200K (tungsten) if color-corrected. Illuminance: 500-5000 lux typical (adjustable via distance, power). CRI >90 (Color Rendering Index) for accurate color reproduction. Energy range: Visible spectrum: 400-700 nm (violet to red); broadband white light sources span full range. Power range: LED panels: 10-100W; continuous tungsten: 500-2000W; flash: 100-1000 Joules per flash. Beam characteristics: Diffuse illumination (softbox, umbrella) for even lighting, minimal shadows. Raking/directional light for surface texture emphasis. Polarized light (with polarizing filters) to eliminate specular reflections.\n\n**Detector:**\nDigital camera sensor: CMOS (most common, low power, fast) or CCD (legacy, high quality). Bayer pattern color filter array (RGGB mosaic) for single-shot color. Full-frame (36×24 mm), APS-C (24×16 mm), medium format (44×33 mm to 54×40 mm) sensor sizes. Spectral range: Silicon-based sensors: peak sensitivity 500-600 nm (green), usable 400-1000 nm (with IR-cut filter limits to ~400-700 nm visible range). Efficiency: Quantum efficiency: 40-80% at peak wavelength (modern BSI-CMOS sensors >70%; older sensors ~40-50%). Time resolution: Shutter speed: 1/8000 s to 30 s (mechanical); 1/32000 s (electronic shutter); bulb mode for longer exposures (minutes-hours for astrophotography; not typical for heritage).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- High-resolution sensor (20-100+ MP; full-frame 45-60 MP or medium-format 100 MP for ultimate detail)\n- High-quality lens (prime lenses sharper than zooms; 50mm f/2.8 macro, 100mm f/2.8 macro, 24mm f/3.5 TS-E for architecture)\n- Stable tripod (heavy-duty; carbon fiber or aluminum; geared head or ball head for precise positioning)\n- Controlled lighting (LED panels with adjustable color temp 3200-5600K, high CRI >95; flash system with softboxes)\n- Color management tools (ColorChecker target in first image; color-managed monitor for review; ICC profiles)\n- Tethering software (Capture One, Lightroom, camera manufacturer software for live view, remote trigger)\n- Storage (high-capacity memory cards: 128-512 GB CFexpress, SD UHS-II; RAID backup for archives)\n- Processing workstation (calibrated monitor, Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop, color-managed workflow)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard heritage photography setup:** Full-frame mirrorless or DSLR (45-60 MP, e.g., Canon EOS R5, Nikon Z7 II, Sony A7R IV). Lens: 100mm f/2.8 macro for objects (1:1 magnification, 0.3 m minimum focus), 24mm f/3.5 TS-E tilt-shift for architecture (perspective control), 50mm f/1.4 for general use. Tripod: Manfrotto or Gitzo carbon fiber, geared head. Lighting: 2-4× LED panels (Westcott or Aputure, 3200-5600K adjustable, CRI 95+, 1000 lux @ 1m), softboxes 60×60 cm for diffusion. Polarizing filters (B+W or Hoya circular polarizer) on lens + polarizers on lights for cross-polarization (eliminate reflections). Color target: X-Rite ColorChecker Passport (24-patch mini target). Tethering: USB-C cable to laptop (MacBook Pro or Windows workstation) running Capture One Pro. Camera settings: Raw format (14-bit), ISO 100-400 (base ISO for max dynamic range, low noise), aperture f/8-f/11 (optimal sharpness, adequate DoF), shutter speed as needed (1/60 s - 1 s typical with tripod). White balance: custom (photograph gray card under same lighting, set WB from that image in raw processing).', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral: 50 μm/pixel (macro, 1:1 magnification, 50 MP sensor) to 5 mm/pixel (architecture, 10 m distance); typical: 0.1-0.5 mm/pixel for objects, 1-5 mm/pixel for large monuments. Depth: No inherent depth resolution (2D imaging); depth of field determines range in acceptable focus: 1-10 mm (macro, wide aperture) to meters (architecture, stopped down aperture). Limiting factors: Sensor resolution (pixel count: 20-100 MP typical; higher = finer detail), Lens quality (MTF, aberrations; high-quality lenses resolve more detail per pixel), Diffraction (small apertures f/16-f/32 reduce resolution; optimal aperture f/8-f/11 for sharpness), Focus accuracy (critical focus required; focus stacking for extended depth of field), Camera stability (tripod essential for high-resolution; vibration/motion blur degrades sharpness), Subject distance (closer = higher resolution; limited by lens minimum focus distance and lighting).\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nVisible light photography is a surface imaging technique capturing reflected light from the top ~0.1-10 μm of opaque materials (skin depth where light reflects). For translucent materials (thin paper, textiles, alabaster, jade), light can penetrate deeper (0.1-10 mm depending on material) via subsurface scattering, emerging with modified spectrum (affects color, reveals internal structure in transmitted light photography). Technique provides no inherent depth information (2D projection), though surface texture visible via shading cues (raking light, shadows).\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nContrast threshold: ~2-5% reflectance difference detectable by human eye in optimal conditions; camera sensor can detect ~1% difference (higher bit depth = better). Minimum feature size: ~2-3 pixels (Nyquist sampling); 1 pixel features alias or disappear. Dynamic range: 8-bit images: 256:1 (2.4 stops); 14-bit raw: 16,384:1 (14 stops) typical for modern cameras. High dynamic range (HDR) multi-exposure: can reach 20+ stops (>10⁶:1) via bracketing and merging. Signal-to-noise: SNR >100:1 for well-exposed images (mid-tones, base ISO). SNR degrades in shadows (low signal) and at high ISO (increased noise). Modern cameras: ISO 100-400 optimal, usable up to ISO 3200-6400 with noise reduction.', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** highly portable\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Not applicable (non-contact imaging; objects photographed in situ or in studio)', 'Object positioned on stable support (archival foam, custom mounts, or display stand).

Lighting artifacts (hotspots from specular reflections; adjust light position or use polarizers).']"], 'data_collection': ["**Step 1: Setup and Preparation**\nSelect appropriate location (studio with controlled lighting, or on-site for immovable objects/architecture). Position object on stable support, neutral background. Set up camera on tripod at appropriate distance (determine field of view, perspective). Level camera (use built-in level or hot-shoe level); ensure sensor plane parallel to object plane (perpendicular to optical axis) to avoid keystone distortion, especially critical for flat artworks (paintings, documents). For architecture: use tilt-shift lens or corrective software. Duration: 15-60 minutes (depends on object complexity, setup complexity). Critical parameters: Camera stable (tripod locked), Sensor parallel to object (minimize distortion), Background neutral and clean, Object secure and safely supported.\n\n**Step 2: Lighting Setup**\nPosition lights for even illumination: 45° angle from left and right (cross-lighting) eliminates shadows for flat documentation. For texture documentation: single light at low angle (raking light, 10-20° from surface) emphasizes relief. Adjust light distance and power to achieve even illumination (check via live view histogram or spot meter; aim for uniformity ±0.5 stop across field). Use softboxes/diffusers to avoid harsh shadows. For reflective objects: large soft sources (umbrellas, diffusion panels) or cross-polarization (polarizers on lights + camera lens) to eliminate glare. Duration: 15-45 minutes (simple setups faster; complex reflective objects require iteration). Critical parameters: Even illumination (no hotspots, shadows), Color temperature consistent (all lights same temp), Intensity adequate but not excessive (avoid overexposure), Cross-polarization if needed (for glass, varnish, metal).\n\n**Step 3: Camera Settings Configuration**\nSet camera to Manual mode (M) for full control. ISO: base ISO (100, 200, or 64 depending on camera) for maximum dynamic range and minimum noise. Aperture: f/8 to f/11 typically (optimal sharpness for most lenses, adequate depth of field for most objects). For deep 3D objects: f/16-f/22 or focus stacking. Shutter speed: determined by light level; use tripod so slow speeds (1/15 s - 2 s) acceptable. White balance: custom WB from gray card (photograph neutral gray card under same lighting, set WB from that image in camera or raw software). File format: RAW (14-bit NEF/CR3/ARW; preserves maximum information for post-processing). Image quality: highest resolution, lossless compression if available. Duration: 10-20 minutes (settings, test shots, refinement). Critical parameters: ISO at base (100-200), Aperture f/8-f/11 (optimal sharpness), RAW format (not JPEG), White balance custom (from gray card under same light).\n\n**Step 4: Focus and Composition**\nCompose image: frame object with small margin (5-10% border); include scale reference (ruler, color/gray card) in first frame or separate frame. Focus critically: use live view magnification (5× or 10×) on critical detail (center of interest, inscription, damage area). Manual focus preferred (autofocus may miss target). For shallow depth of field: focus 1/3 into depth of object (maximizes DoF front-to-back via hyperfocal principle). For very shallow DoF or 3D objects: focus stacking (see advanced techniques). Lock focus (switch lens to manual after focusing; don't touch focus ring). Check composition and edges (verify object fully in frame, parallel to edges, scale visible if included). Duration: 5-15 minutes per setup/view. Critical parameters: Critical focus (use live view magnification), Composition tight but complete (object fills frame with margin), Scale visible if required, Manual focus locked (won't drift between shots).\n\n**Step 5: Test Exposure and Histogram Check**\nCapture test image. Review histogram (RGB or luminance): ideal histogram has peak in mid-tones (center), no clipping on left (shadows) or right (highlights). Slight right-bias acceptable ('expose to the right' or ETTR: maximizes signal, minimizes noise, but avoid highlight clipping on important areas). Check for overexposure: blinking highlights (zebra pattern in playback). If clipping: reduce exposure (decrease shutter speed or increase aperture slightly, or reduce light intensity). If too dark: increase exposure. Bracket if unsure: ±1 stop (3 images at different exposures can be merged to HDR later). Check sharpness: zoom to 100% in playback, inspect critical areas. If soft: re-check focus, check for camera shake (use 2-sec self-timer or remote release to avoid vibration from shutter press). Duration: 5-10 minutes (test, review, adjust, retest). Critical parameters: Histogram optimal (no clipping, mid-tones centered), Sharp focus at 100% zoom, No camera shake (use remote release or timer), Bracketing if high contrast scene (±1 stop).\n\n**Step 6: Systematic Image Acquisition**\nCapture final images systematically: (1) Overall view (full object, scale + color target visible). (2) Details (close-ups of significant features: inscriptions, condition issues, decorative elements; maintain same lighting, change camera position/focal length to fill frame with detail). (3) Multiple angles (3D objects: front, back, sides, top; rotate object or move camera; maintain consistent lighting). (4) Raking light views (if needed for texture: low-angle single light source emphasizes surface relief; capture at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° azimuths to see all textures). (5) Transmitted light (for translucent materials: backlight with diffused light box or LED panel, photograph from front). Document: use tethered shooting (images transfer immediately to computer for review), or shoot to card and download frequently. Label files systematically (object ID, view, date, sequence number). Duration: Variable: 30 minutes for simple object (5-10 images); 2-4 hours for complex object (50-100 images including details). Critical parameters: Systematic coverage (all views, details documented), Consistent lighting and settings (for comparability across image set), Immediate review (check each image at 100% zoom for sharpness, exposure), Files labeled/organized (object ID, view descriptor in filename or metadata).\n\n**Step 7: Color Reference Capture**\nInclude color/gray target in at least one image per lighting setup (first image of series): X-Rite ColorChecker or similar positioned next to object in same plane, same lighting. Ensure target well-exposed (histogram midtones for gray patches), in focus, flat (not wrinkled or curved). This reference image enables accurate color correction in post-processing (create ICC profile or manual color balance from known target values). Optionally: capture separate reference image (target only, fills frame) for highest accuracy if target small in object images. Duration: 2-5 minutes. Critical parameters: Color target in same lighting as object, Target in focus and well-exposed, Target flat and clean (no shadows, dirt, wear on patches).\n\n**Step 8: Quality Control and Backup**\nReview all images: check histogram (exposure correct), zoom to 100% (sharpness, focus), verify coverage (all required views captured). If any issues: re-shoot immediately while setup intact. Backup: copy raw files to at least two locations (primary storage + backup drive; or computer + network storage). Verify file integrity (check file size, open a few files to confirm not corrupted). Document session: record metadata (object ID, date, photographer, camera/lens used, lighting setup notes, any special considerations) in spreadsheet or database, or in EXIF metadata fields. Duration: 15-30 minutes (review and backup for typical session). Critical parameters: All images reviewed at 100% zoom, Exposure and focus verified, Files backed up (two locations minimum), Session documented (metadata recorded)."], 'calibration': ['**Standards:** Color target: X-Rite ColorChecker (24 or 48 patches), Datacolor SpyderCHECKR (known spectral reflectance). Gray card: 18% reflectance neutral gray (Kodak, X-Rite) for exposure metering and white balance. Scale reference: metric ruler, photographic scale bar (graduated in cm/mm) for dimensional reference. Resolution target: USAF 1951 test pattern or ISO 12233 chart (for lens MTF testing, focus accuracy verification). Monitor calibration: X-Rite i1Display Pro, Datacolor SpyderX (hardware colorimeter + software for display profiling).\n\n**Frequency:** Per session: Color target in first image of each lighting setup (ensures color accuracy for that setup). Monitor calibration: monthly (or weekly for critical color work; displays drift over time). Camera/lens calibration: verify focus accuracy (phase-detection AF) annually or if suspect front/back-focus; most modern cameras have AF micro-adjustment. Gray card: each session for exposure check, custom white balance.\n\n**Procedure:** **Color calibration:** (1) Photograph color target (ColorChecker) in first frame under same lighting as object. (2) In raw processing software (Lightroom, Capture One), use color target tool to create camera/lighting profile or adjust color manually (match target patches to known reference values). (3) Apply profile to all images from that session. **Exposure calibration:** Photograph gray card (fills frame), adjust exposure so gray card meters at 18% reflectance (middle gray in histogram, RGB ~118/255 in 8-bit). Use this exposure for object. **White balance calibration:** Photograph gray card, use eyedropper in raw software to set neutral gray → gives correct WB for that lighting. **Monitor calibration:** Run colorimeter software (i1Profiler, SpyderX), place colorimeter on screen, software displays color patches, colorimeter measures, creates ICC profile for monitor. Set OS/software to use profile.']}, 'data_outputs': '**Raw Data Format:**\nRAW: NEF (Nikon), CR3/CR2 (Canon), ARW (Sony), DNG (Adobe universal RAW), IIQ (Phase One). Output: TIFF (16-bit, uncompressed or LZW compression; archival), JPEG (8-bit, lossy compression; web/display), PSD (Adobe Photoshop format; preserves layers, adjustments). Data structure: RAW: single-channel sensor data (Bayer mosaic) + metadata (EXIF: camera settings, lens, exposure). TIFF/JPEG: demosaiced RGB color (3 channels), optionally with embedded ICC profile. Metadata: EXIF, IPTC (caption, copyright), XMP (editing history, keywords). Typical file size: RAW: 50-150 MB per image (45-100 MP cameras, 14-16 bit). TIFF: 150-300 MB (uncompressed 16-bit RGB, 45-100 MP). JPEG: 10-30 MB (8-bit, quality 90-100%, 45-100 MP).', 'data_analysis_pipeline': {'preprocessing': "- RAW conversion (demosaicing): Convert Bayer RAW data to full RGB image. Software (Lightroom, Capture One, DxO PhotoLab) applies demosaicing algorithm (interpolates missing R, G, B values at each pixel from surrounding pixels). Apply lens profile correction (distortion, chromatic aberration, vignetting). Set white balance, exposure, tone curve, sharpening. Software: Adobe Lightroom Classic, Capture One Pro, DxO PhotoLab, RawTherapee (open-source).\n- Color correction: Match image colors to reality using color target: create ICC profile from ColorChecker (camera-specific profile for that lighting), or manual adjustment (use color picker on gray/white patch → set neutral, adjust other patches to target values). Apply to all images from same session. Verify neutrals appear neutral (gray card appears gray, not tinted). Software: Lightroom (color calibration panel), X-Rite ColorChecker Camera Calibration software, BasICColor.\n- Exposure and tone adjustment: Fine-tune exposure (overall brightness), adjust highlights (recover clipped highlights if RAW headroom available), shadows (lift to reveal detail without excess noise), whites/blacks (set white/black points). Apply tone curve (S-curve for contrast, or custom for desired look). Aim: histogram well-distributed, no clipping (unless intentional in background), detail visible in all important areas. Software: Lightroom (Develop module), Photoshop (Camera Raw), Capture One.\n- Sharpening: Apply capture sharpening (compensate for AA filter, lens softness). Use unsharp mask or modern algorithms (deconvolution sharpening in Capture One, AI sharpening in Topaz). Settings: Amount 40-80%, Radius 0.8-1.5 pixels (for typical viewing distance), Threshold ~0 for overall sharpening or ~10 to avoid amplifying noise. Apply globally or selectively (sharpen detail areas, leave smooth areas). Software: Lightroom (sharpening panel), Photoshop (Smart Sharpen, Unsharp Mask), Capture One, Topaz Sharpen AI.\n- Noise reduction (if needed): For images with visible noise (high ISO, underexposure): apply luminance noise reduction (smooths brightness variations) and color noise reduction (removes color speckles). Balance noise reduction vs. detail preservation (aggressive NR blurs fine detail). Typically: luminance NR ~30-50, color NR ~25-40 in Lightroom scale. Alternatively: AI-based NR (Topaz DeNoise AI, DxO Prime) for better detail preservation. Software: Lightroom (detail panel), Topaz DeNoise AI, DxO PhotoLab (PRIME noise reduction).\n- Cropping and straightening: Crop to final composition (remove extraneous background, center object, apply rule-of-thirds if artistic). Straighten (rotate to level horizon or align object edges with frame edges). For archival/documentation: minimal crop (preserve all information); tight crop to object edges acceptable if annotated (original frame preserved in RAW or separate master TIFF). Software: Lightroom (crop tool), Photoshop.\n- Retouching (optional, for publication): Remove temporary elements (dust on sensor causing spots, modern labels/supports if distracting). Healing/cloning tools (Photoshop healing brush, clone stamp). For heritage: retouch only temporary artifacts, NEVER alter object itself (authentic condition must be preserved). Document any retouching (note in metadata: 'sensor dust removed; object unaltered'). Software: Photoshop (healing brush, clone stamp, content-aware fill).\n- Export and archiving: Export master TIFF (16-bit, Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB color space, uncompressed or LZW, embedded ICC profile). For web/print: export derivatives (JPEG 8-bit sRGB for web at appropriate resolution ~2000 px long dimension; TIFF or JPEG Adobe RGB at 300 ppi for print). Archive: store RAW + master TIFF + metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP sidecar) on redundant storage (RAID, cloud backup). Software: Lightroom (export presets), Photoshop (Save As), batch export scripts.", 'analysis_workflow': "**Step 1: Image Import and Organization**\nImport RAW files into cataloging software (Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic). Organize into collections/folders by object, session date, or project. Apply initial metadata (IPTC): photographer name, copyright, caption template (object ID, institution). Cull: review all images, flag best (5-star or color label), reject out-of-focus/poorly-exposed images. Archive rejects separately (may be useful later for documentation of process or comparison).\n\n**Step 2: Color Calibration from Target**\nLocate image with color/gray target. In RAW processing software: use color target tool (Lightroom: Color Checker plugin or manual; Capture One: built-in Color Tool). Software reads target patches, compares to known values, creates camera/lighting profile or adjustment settings. Apply profile to all images from same lighting setup (batch apply via sync settings). Verify: neutral patches (gray, white, black on ColorChecker) appear neutral (no color cast), color patches approximately match visual expectation.\n\n**Step 3: Batch Adjustments (Exposure, WB, Lens Corrections)**\nSelect all images from session (or lighting setup subset). Apply lens profile correction (auto-detected from EXIF metadata: camera + lens model → corrects distortion, vignetting, chromatic aberration). Set white balance from gray card image (or from color target neutral patch). Adjust exposure if needed (small global adjustment to compensate for systematic over/under; ±0.3-0.5 stops typical). Apply to batch (sync settings across all images). Individual fine-tuning later as needed.\n\n**Step 4: Individual Image Optimization**\nFor each final-selected image (overall views, key details): fine-tune exposure and tone (histogram optimization, shadow/highlight recovery), sharpening (amount appropriate for image scale and intended use), noise reduction if needed (high ISO or underexposed areas), cropping/straightening (final composition). Verify at 100% zoom: sharpness good, noise acceptable, no artifacts (halos from oversharpening, banding from excessive adjustments). Tag/label for different uses (e.g., 'web', 'print', 'archive master').\n\n**Step 5: Export Master Files (Archival TIFFs)**\nExport final color-corrected, adjusted images as master TIFFs: 16-bit depth, Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB color space (wide gamut preserves color information), uncompressed or LZW compression (lossless), embed ICC profile. Filename: include object ID, view descriptor, date, version (e.g., '2025-001_FrontView_20250115_v01.tif'). These are archival masters (preserve maximum information for future use, re-processing, derivative generation).\n\n**Step 6: Derivative Generation (Web, Print, Display)**\nFrom master TIFFs, generate derivatives for specific uses: **Web/online:** JPEG, sRGB color space, 8-bit, ~2000-3000 px on long dimension (typical web display resolution), quality 80-90% (balance file size vs. quality), embed sRGB profile, metadata (copyright, caption). **Print:** TIFF or JPEG, Adobe RGB, 8 or 16-bit, resolution 300 ppi at final print size, unsharp mask for print sharpening, embed Adobe RGB profile. **Presentation (PowerPoint, etc.):** JPEG, sRGB, 1920×1080 px (HD) or 3840×2160 px (4K), quality 90%. **Thumbnail:** JPEG, sRGB, 200-400 px, quality 70-80%. Automate via export presets (Lightroom export settings, Photoshop actions).\n\n**Step 7: Metadata Enrichment**\nAdd comprehensive metadata to master files and/or catalog database: IPTC (caption: object title, artist, date; keywords: subject, medium, condition terms; copyright notice, photographer name, institution), EXIF (camera settings preserved from RAW), custom fields (object ID, accession number, conservation treatment reference, related images). Use controlled vocabularies (Getty AAT, TGN for consistency). Embed metadata in files (XMP sidecar or in TIFF header) and in catalog database (searchable).\n\n**Step 8: Quality Assurance and Documentation**\nReview final exports: verify file integrity (open files, check for corruption), color accuracy (view on calibrated monitor, compare to object if available or to memory/notes), resolution appropriate (zoom to 100%, verify detail level), metadata complete (all required fields populated). Generate documentation: contact sheet (thumbnail overview of session), file list with metadata, session notes (lighting setup, any issues, special techniques used). Archive raw files + masters + derivatives + documentation in repository (institutional server, RAID storage, cloud backup)."}, 'artifacts_troubleshooting': '**Troubleshooting:**\n- Exposure correct (histogram shows no clipping in highlights/shadows; mid-tones centered)\n- White balance accurate (neutrals appear neutral; color target patches match references)\n- Focus sharp (100% zoom inspection shows crisp detail at intended focus point)\n- Depth of field adequate (all important areas within acceptable focus range)\n- No camera shake/motion blur (100% zoom shows sharp edges, no streaking; use tripod + timer/remote)\n- Lighting even (no harsh shadows, hotspots, or falloff; ±0.5 stop across field)\n- No lens distortion artifacts (straight lines straight, especially edges; use tilt-shift or correct in post)\n- Color fringing minimal (chromatic aberration controlled; check high-contrast edges at 100% zoom)\n- File format correct (RAW, 14-16 bit; not JPEG 8-bit)\n- Files backed up (two locations minimum; verify integrity)\n- Metadata complete (object ID, date, photographer, camera settings documented)', 'multimodal_pairings': '**Complementary Techniques:**\n\n- infrared-reflectography\n\n- uv-fluorescence\n\n- xrf\n\n- raman-microscopy\n\n- stereo-photogrammetry\n\n- multispectral-imaging', 'strengths_limitations': {'strengths': ['See technique documentation'], 'limitations': ['See technique documentation']}, 'lab_checklist': ['Exposure correct (histogram shows no clipping in highlights/shadows; mid-tones centered)', 'White balance accurate (neutrals appear neutral; color target patches match references)', 'Focus sharp (100% zoom inspection shows crisp detail at intended focus point)', 'Depth of field adequate (all important areas within acceptable focus range)', 'No camera shake/motion blur (100% zoom shows sharp edges, no streaking; use tripod + timer/remote)', 'Lighting even (no harsh shadows, hotspots, or falloff; ±0.5 stop across field)', 'No lens distortion artifacts (straight lines straight, especially edges; use tilt-shift or correct in post)', 'Color fringing minimal (chromatic aberration controlled; check high-contrast edges at 100% zoom)', 'File format correct (RAW, 14-16 bit; not JPEG 8-bit)', 'Files backed up (two locations minimum; verify integrity)', 'Metadata complete (object ID, date, photographer, camera settings documented)'], 'keywords': ['visible photography', 'high-resolution imaging', 'digital photography', 'documentation', 'color calibration', 'conservation photography', 'gigapixel', 'RAW workflow', 'visual documentation', 'heritage imaging', 'museum photography']}
