Unlike traditional spectroscopy that measures intensity versus frequency, THz-TDS directly measures the electric field amplitude and phase of coherent terahertz pulses transmitted through or reflected from a sample as a function of time. Fourier transformation of the time-domain signal yields complex-valued frequency-domain spectra, providing both absorption (real) and refractive index (imaginary) information simultaneously. The terahertz region is sensitive to rotational and vibrational modes in molecules, lattice vibrations in crystals, and free carrier dynamics in semiconductors, while also penetrating many dielectric materials (paper, textiles, ceramics, dried paint). In cultural heritage, THz-TDS enables subsurface imaging of multi-layer structures (paintings, murals, manuscripts), identification of pigments and materials through spectral fingerprinting, detection of hidden features (underdrawings, pentimenti, text), and characterization of degradation without contact or ionizing radiation.', 'abstract': 'Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a non-contact, non-destructive analytical technique that uses electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz frequency range (0.1-10 THz, λ = 30 μm - 3 mm) to probe the structural, chemical, and electronic properties of materials.

Generation: femtosecond laser pulse (800 nm, ~100 fs duration) illuminates photoconductive antenna or nonlinear crystal, producing single-cycle THz pulse (~1 ps duration, 0.1-3 THz bandwidth). This THz pulse propagates through or reflects from sample. Detection: time-delayed portion of same laser pulse gates a second photoconductive antenna, sampling the THz electric field at different time delays via optical rectification or electro-optic sampling. Scanning the time delay (using motorized delay stage) maps out the complete THz waveform E(t) with sub-picosecond resolution. Fourier transform yields complex frequency spectrum Ẽ(ω) = |E(ω)|e^(iφ(ω)), providing both amplitude and phase. Comparing sample spectrum to reference (no sample) yields absorption coefficient α(ω) and refractive index n(ω). These material-specific optical constants reveal molecular structure, lattice dynamics, and sample morphology.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nTHz generation: (1) Photoconductive antenna (most common), or (2) Optical rectification in nonlinear crystal (ZnTe, GaP, DAST). Pump laser: Ti:sapphire or fiber laser (800 nm or 1550 nm, 100 fs pulses, 80-100 MHz rep rate, 10-100 mW average power). THz output: broadband pulse (0.1-4 THz typical), peak field 1-100 kV/cm, average power 1-100 μW. THz photon energy: 0.4-40 meV (0.1-10 THz), corresponding to 4-400 cm⁻¹ or λ = 30 μm - 3 mm. Average THz power: 1-100 μW (peak power during pulse: mW-level but 100 fs duration → low average). Pulsed (single-cycle pulses, ~1 ps duration); coherent (phase-stable); broadband (octave-spanning spectrum); Gaussian beam profile.\n\n**Detector:**\nPhotoconductive antenna (gated detection), Electro-optic sampling (in ZnTe, GaP crystal), or Bolometer (incoherent detection, less common for TDS). Sensitive to 0.1-10 THz (limited by generation bandwidth and detector response). Quantum efficiency ~10⁻⁶-10⁻⁴ for photoconductive detection (very low, but coherent detection enables high SNR via lock-in). Time resolution: Sub-picosecond (limited by laser pulse width and gate pulse duration; <100 fs achievable).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Stable femtosecond laser (amplitude and timing stability critical for coherent detection)\n- Precision optical delay line (sub-μm positioning accuracy, 0-300 ps range)\n- High-efficiency THz emitter/detector pair (photoconductive antennas with optimized bias and laser power)\n- Low-loss THz optics (parabolic mirrors preferred over lenses; avoid water vapor absorption in beam path)\n- Dry air or N₂ purge (eliminate water vapor absorption, which has strong lines at 1.1, 1.7, 2.5 THz)\n- Vibration isolation (mechanical stability essential for μm-scale alignment)\n- Lock-in amplifier (phase-sensitive detection recovers weak signals from noise)\n- Motorized sample stage (automated 2D/3D raster scanning for imaging)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard transmission THz-TDS:** Ti:sapphire laser (800 nm, 80 MHz, 100 fs pulses, 500 mW). 80:20 beam splitter: 80% to emitter (photoconductive antenna biased at 20-50 V), 20% to probe arm. Delay line: retroreflector on motorized stage (300 mm travel, 2 ps range). THz beam collimated and focused by 90° off-axis parabolic mirrors (f = 50-100 mm, spot size ~2 mm at focus). Sample on motorized XY stage at focus. Transmitted THz collected by second parabolic mirror, focused onto detector antenna. Lock-in amplifier (ref: laser rep rate or chopped emitter bias). Dry air purge (RH < 5%) or N₂ flow enclosure. Acquisition: scan delay 0-50 ps in 50 fs steps (1000 points), 10 ms integration per point → 10 sec per waveform. 2D imaging: 50 × 50 pixels, 10 sec/pixel → 7 hours (or faster with reduced integration).', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 150 μm - 1.5 mm (diffraction-limited; depends on frequency and focusing optics). Depth Resolution: 10-100 μm (depends on pulse duration and material dispersion). Limiting factors: Wavelength (0.03-3 mm): diffraction limits lateral resolution to ~λ/2, Pulse duration (~1 ps): limits temporal (depth) resolution to ~300 μm in free space, Material dispersion: pulse broadening in sample degrades depth resolution, Signal-to-noise ratio: weak signals limit ability to resolve small features, Scattering: rough interfaces, heterogeneous materials scatter THz (reduce penetration/resolution), Water absorption: moisture in sample attenuates signal, limiting depth and resolution.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nTHz-TDS can probe subsurface layers to depths of 100 μm - 10 mm depending on material properties. Penetration depth δ = 1/α where α is absorption coefficient. Non-polar, dry materials (paper, dried paint, ceramics) are relatively transparent (low α), enabling deep penetration. Polar materials (water, alcohols) and conductors (metals, salts) strongly absorb THz, limiting penetration to surface (<100 μm). Dry paper and parchment: 1-10 mm (multi-sheet penetration), low water content → transparent; can image through ~10-20 sheets. Dried oil paint (lean): 0.5-5 mm (multiple layers), depends on pigment; lead white, ochres relatively transparent; carbon black opaque. Tempera and fresco: 0.2-2 mm, aqueous binders; if fully dried, moderately transparent. Textiles (dry cotton, linen, silk): 5-20 mm (multiple fabric layers), low absorption enables seeing through layers. Ceramics and pottery: 1-10 mm, depends on composition and porosity; glazes may be opaque if metallic. Moist materials (wet paint, humid paper): <100 μm, water strongly absorbs THz (>100 cm⁻¹ at 1 THz); surface only. Metals and graphite: <1 μm (skin depth), highly reflective; THz does not penetrate conductors. Salts (NaCl, gypsum, efflorescence): <50 μm, ionic materials absorb strongly via lattice resonances.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nThin layer detection: ~10-50 μm thickness (if sufficient refractive index contrast). Material identification: ~1-5% concentration for strongly absorbing species in matrix. Dynamic range: 10³-10⁴ in amplitude (30-40 dB in power) typical for commercial systems; can reach 10⁵-10⁶ (50-60 dB) with optimization. Signal-to-noise: SNR 1000:1 to 10,000:1 achievable for strong reflectors; degrades for weak signals (thin layers, low contrast).', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** non-destructive\n\n**Portability:** laboratory-based\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Sampling required: No - transmission: <10 × 10 cm (beam size ~2-5 mm, raster scan for larger areas); reflection: any size (limited by stage); thickness: ideally <5 mm for transmission (depends on absorption)', 'Position sample on motorized XY stage at THz focus', 'For transmission: sample should be perpendicular to beam (use alignment laser)', 'Flat samples: mount on low-absorption holder (HDPE, quartz window)', 'Curved objects: may require rotation stage or reflection geometry', 'No pressure or contact needed (non-contact measurement)', 'No preparation required for most heritage objects (non-invasive)', 'Clean surface (remove dust) with soft brush if needed', 'Avoid moisture (wet cleaning) before measurement - water absorbs THz strongly', 'For very rough surfaces: reflection mode better than transmission (specular reflection component)', 'Not required - THz-TDS is non-invasive subsurface technique', 'However, if destructive cross-section available (from conservation sampling), can correlate THz findings with optical microscopy, SEM, etc.', 'Moisture: ambient humidity absorbs THz in beam path; sample moisture strongly attenuates signal.

Software: MATLAB, Python (NumPy)\n- Windowing (apodization): Apply window function (Hann, Blackman-Harris) to time-domain waveform before FFT to reduce spectral leakage. Critical for accurate peak positions.

Use 1D unwrapping algorithms. Software: MATLAB unwrap, Python numpy.unwrap\n- Noise filtering: For low-SNR data: apply Savitzky-Golay smoothing or wavelet denoising to time-domain or frequency-domain data. Use cautiously - can distort features. Software: MATLAB, Python (scipy.signal)', 'analysis_workflow': '**STEP 1: Data Import and Visualization**\n- Load time-domain waveforms: reference E_ref(t) and sample E_sample(t). Plot both on same axes. Visually inspect: note time delay of sample pulse (indicates refractive index > 1), amplitude reduction (absorption), pulse broadening (dispersion). Check for artifacts (clipping, noise spikes, etalon ringing).\n\n**STEP 2: Fourier Transform to Frequency Domain**\n- Apply FFT to both waveforms: Ẽ_ref(ω) = FFT[E_ref(t)], Ẽ_sample(ω) = FFT[E_sample(t)]. Extract amplitude |E(ω)| and phase φ(ω) for both. Plot amplitude spectra: verify frequency range and SNR. Typical usable bandwidth: 0.1-3 THz (where SNR >10:1). Phase: unwrap to obtain continuous φ(ω).\n\n**STEP 3: Transmission/Reflection Coefficient Calculation**\n- Compute complex transmission: T̃(ω) = Ẽ_sample(ω) / Ẽ_ref(ω). Extract amplitude transmission T = |T̃(ω)| and phase φ_T = arg[T̃(ω)]. For reflection: compute reflection coefficient R̃(ω) similarly. Plot T(ω) and φ_T(ω) vs. frequency.\n\n**STEP 4: Material Parameter Extraction (n, κ, α)**\n- From transmission T̃(ω) and known sample thickness d, extract complex refractive index ñ(ω) = n(ω) + iκ(ω). Method: (1) Simple thin-sample approximation: n ≈ 1 + (c/ωd)φ_T. (2) Exact: solve Fresnel equations iteratively accounting for multiple reflections (more accurate but computationally intensive). Extract absorption coefficient: α(ω) = 2ωκ/c. Plot n(ω) and α(ω).\n\n**STEP 5: Spectroscopic Analysis and Fingerprinting**\n- Compare measured absorption spectrum α(ω) to reference spectra (library of heritage materials, pigments, binders). Identify spectral features: peaks correspond to molecular vibrations, phonons, or other resonances characteristic of materials. For unknown sample: match spectrum to database; for known sample: verify identity, detect adulterants or degradation products.\n\n**STEP 6: Time-Domain Analysis (Layer Thickness, Depth Profiling)**\n- Examine time-domain waveform for echoes (reflections from subsurface interfaces). Time delay between echoes Δt relates to layer thickness: d = c·Δt / (2n). Multi-layer structures: deconvolve overlapping echoes using inverse filtering or model fitting. Build depth profile: layer sequence, thicknesses, approximate refractive indices.\n\n**STEP 7: Imaging Analysis (2D/3D Reconstruction)**\n- For imaging datasets E(x,y,t): extract specific time slices (depth-resolved images) or integrate over time (transmission map). Generate pseudo-color images showing absorption or refractive index variation across sample. For tomography: apply filtered back-projection or iterative reconstruction to obtain 3D volume. Segment layers, identify hidden features.\n\n**STEP 8: Quantitative Metrics and Statistical Analysis**\n- Calculate metrics: average refractive index n̄, absorption coefficient ᾱ, layer thicknesses, interface roughness (from echo broadening). For comparative studies: statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA) on extracted parameters across samples or treatments.
