Secondary electrons (E < 50 eV) are generated within the top 5-10 nm of the sample surface through inelastic scattering, making SE imaging extremely surface-sensitive and ideal for topographic characterization. The technique achieves nanometer-scale lateral resolution (1-10 nm) with exceptional depth of field (100-1000× greater than optical microscopy), enabling detailed examination of surface morphology, texture, particle structure, degradation features, and biological specimens in heritage materials.', 'abstract': 'Scanning Electron Microscopy using secondary electron (SE) detection is a high-resolution surface imaging technique that produces three-dimensional-appearing images by detecting low-energy electrons emitted from the sample surface when scanned by a focused electron beam.

Primary electrons undergo inelastic collisions with sample atoms, transferring energy to loosely-bound outer-shell electrons. If transferred energy exceeds the work function (3-5 eV for most materials), these electrons escape as secondary electrons (SE, E < 50 eV typically, peak at ~3-5 eV). Due to their low energy, only SE generated within the top 5-10 nm (escape depth) can exit the surface. SE yield depends strongly on surface topography: edges and protrusions produce more SE (electric field enhancement), depressions produce fewer (shadowing). Everhart-Thornley detector (scintillator-photomultiplier) collects SE with high efficiency. Point-by-point scanning and synchronous SE intensity measurement create topographic image.', 'instruments_components': '**Source:**\nElectron gun (thermionic tungsten, LaB₆, or field-emission gun FEG). Tungsten: 15-30 keV, brightness ~10⁵ A/cm²·sr; LaB₆: 0.5-30 keV, ~10⁶ A/cm²·sr; FEG: 0.1-30 keV, >10⁹ A/cm²·sr. 0.1-30 keV (modern SEMs); heritage applications typically 1-20 keV. Beam current: 1 pA - 100 nA (adjustable via condenser lens). Probe size: 1 nm (FEG) to 10-50 nm (tungsten); convergence angle: 5-10 mrad.\n\n**Detector:**\nEverhart-Thornley detector (standard SE detector), In-lens SE detector (high-resolution, low kV), Through-the-lens detector (TLD), or Energy-selective detectors (filter SE1 vs. SE2). Sensitive to SE (E < 50 eV); some BSE contamination (can be biased to reject). Everhart-Thornley: >80% collection efficiency with positive grid bias; in-lens: >90%. Time resolution: Nanosecond (allows real-time imaging, typically scan at 30 Hz - 1 kHz).\n\n**Critical Components:**\n- Electron gun with stable emission (field-emission preferred for high resolution)\n- Everhart-Thornley detector (scintillator converts SE → light; PMT amplifies signal)\n- High-vacuum system (chamber at 10⁻⁵ - 10⁻⁶ mbar to prevent electron scattering)\n- Vibration isolation (critical for high magnification; pneumatic or active isolation)\n- Electromagnetic shielding (prevent external fields from deflecting beam)\n- Sputter coater (Au, Pt, Au/Pd coating ~5-10 nm for insulators)\n- Digital image acquisition system (frame averaging, drift correction)\n- Stage with precise XYZ positioning (sub-micrometer accuracy)\n\n**Typical Configuration:**\n**Standard SEM for heritage:** Tungsten or LaB₆ filament SEM. Accelerating voltage: 5-20 kV. Chamber size accommodates samples up to 10 cm diameter. Working distance: 10 mm. Everhart-Thornley SE detector at 45° to beam axis. Vacuum: 10⁻⁵ mbar (turbomolecular pump). Magnification range: 10× - 100,000×. Digital image capture: 1024 × 768 or higher resolution. Sputter coater: Au/Pd target, 10-20 nm coating thickness. Analysis time: 5-15 minutes per sample after coating.', 'resolution_detection': '**Spatial Resolution:**\nLateral Resolution: 1-10 nm (modern field-emission SEM at low kV); 5-50 nm (tungsten filament SEM). Depth Resolution: 5-10 nm (SE escape depth; extreme surface sensitivity). Limiting factors: Electron source type (field-emission gun: ~1 nm probe; tungsten: ~5-10 nm probe), Accelerating voltage (lower voltage = smaller interaction volume = better resolution but lower signal), Beam current (higher current = brighter image but larger probe size due to aberrations), Sample charging (insulators deflect beam, degrading resolution), Contamination (hydrocarbons polymerize under beam, reducing contrast), Vibration and electromagnetic interference.\n\n**Interaction Depth:**\nSE imaging is extremely surface-sensitive. SE escape depth λ_SE ~ 5-10 nm for most materials, meaning only SE generated within top 10 nm can contribute to image. However, primary electron penetration (interaction volume) extends 0.1-5 μm depending on accelerating voltage and material density. Deeper primary electrons generate SE that cannot escape (absorbed internally) but contribute to backscattered electrons (different signal). Organic materials (paint, paper, wood): SE from top 5-10 nm; primary penetration ~1-3 μm, low-Z materials have deeper primary penetration but same SE escape depth. Metals (bronze, silver, gold): SE from top 3-5 nm; primary penetration ~0.1-1 μm, high-Z materials have shallow penetration; true surface imaging. Ceramics and glass: SE from top 5-10 nm; primary penetration ~0.5-2 μm, intermediate Z; moderate penetration. Biological specimens (pollen, fungi): SE from top 5-10 nm; very surface-sensitive, critical for visualizing surface ultrastructure. Carbon-coated samples: SE dominated by 5-10 nm carbon layer, coating masks original surface detail at nanometer scale.\n\n**Detection Limits:**\nTopographic features: ~1 nm height difference detectable; contrast depends on δ variation (5-10% minimum). Dynamic range: 10³-10⁴ (gray levels in digital image; detector dynamic range). Signal-to-noise: SNR 20-100:1 typical for good imaging conditions; improves with averaging.', 'sample_requirements': "**Destructiveness:** minimally-invasive\n\n**Portability:** laboratory-only\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\n['Sampling required: Yes - typically 5-50 mm diameter;
